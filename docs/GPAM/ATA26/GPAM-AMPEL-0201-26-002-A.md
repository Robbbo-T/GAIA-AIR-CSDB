# Fire Suppression System Description (S1000D)

**Document Code:** GPAM-AMPEL-0201-26-002-A

## Introduction

The Fire Suppression System Description document for the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft provides detailed information about the fire suppression system installed on the aircraft. This document outlines the components, operation, and maintenance procedures for the fire suppression system to ensure the safety and airworthiness of the aircraft.

## System Overview

The fire suppression system on the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft is designed to extinguish fires in critical areas of the aircraft. The system consists of the following main components:

- Fire extinguishers
- Fire suppression control units
- Discharge nozzles
- Warning indicators
- Wiring and connectors

## Components

### Fire Extinguishers

Fire extinguishers are installed in various compartments of the aircraft, including the engine nacelles, APU compartment, and cargo hold. These extinguishers use different types of fire suppression agents, such as Halon, water, or foam, to extinguish fires.

### Fire Suppression Control Units

The fire suppression control units are responsible for processing signals from the fire detection system and activating the appropriate fire extinguishers. These units are typically located in the avionics bay and are connected to the aircraft's central warning system.

### Discharge Nozzles

Discharge nozzles are installed in the areas where fire extinguishers are located. These nozzles are designed to distribute the fire suppression agent evenly and effectively to extinguish the fire.

### Warning Indicators

Warning indicators are installed in the cockpit to alert the flight crew to the activation of the fire suppression system. These indicators include visual and audible alarms, such as warning lights and sirens, to ensure the crew is immediately aware of the situation.

### Wiring and Connectors

The fire suppression system is connected by a network of wiring and connectors that transmit signals between the fire detection system, control units, and fire extinguishers. This wiring is routed through the aircraft's structure and is protected by fire-resistant insulation.

## Operation

The fire suppression system operates in conjunction with the fire detection system. When the fire detection system senses the presence of fire or smoke, it sends a signal to the fire suppression control unit. The control unit processes the signal and activates the appropriate fire extinguishers. The fire suppression agent is then discharged through the nozzles to extinguish the fire.

## Maintenance Procedures

Regular maintenance of the fire suppression system is essential to ensure its proper operation and reliability. The following maintenance tasks should be performed at the specified intervals:

### Monthly Inspection

- Inspect fire extinguishers for damage or leakage
- Test the operation of the fire suppression control units
- Verify the functionality of warning indicators
- Check wiring and connectors for signs of wear or damage

### Annual Inspection

- Perform all tasks listed for the monthly inspection
- Replace fire extinguishers if the expiration date has passed
- Test the entire fire suppression system for proper operation

## Documentation and Records

All maintenance activities must be documented in the aircraft's maintenance logbook. The following information should be recorded for each maintenance task:

- Date and time of maintenance
- Description of task performed
- Name and signature of technician
- Part numbers and serial numbers of replaced components
- Any discrepancies or issues found and corrective actions taken

## Compliance and Certification

The Fire Suppression System Description document complies with the following regulatory requirements and standards:

- Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations
- European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations
- International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards
- Manufacturer's maintenance manual and service bulletins

## Conclusion

The Fire Suppression System Description document for the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft provides essential information for the operation and maintenance of the fire suppression system. By adhering to the procedures and guidelines outlined in this document, operators can ensure the safety and airworthiness of the aircraft.
