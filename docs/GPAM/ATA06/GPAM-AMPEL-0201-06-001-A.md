## Reference Points and Stations

The following sections outline the reference points and station locations used for measurements and alignment on the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft.

### Reference Points

- **Nose Reference Point (NRP):** The forward-most point of the aircraft, used as a reference for longitudinal measurements.
- **Wing Root Reference Point (WRRP):** The point where the wing meets the fuselage, used as a reference for lateral measurements.
- **Tail Reference Point (TRP):** The aft-most point of the aircraft, used as a reference for longitudinal measurements.

### Station Locations

The station locations are defined along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, measured in inches from the Nose Reference Point (NRP). The following table provides an overview of the key station locations:

| Station        | Location (inches) | Description                           |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Station 0      | 0                 | Nose Reference Point (NRP)            |
| Station 100    | 100               | Forward fuselage section              |
| Station 200    | 200               | Wing root section                     |
| Station 300    | 300               | Aft fuselage section                  |
| Station 400    | 400               | Tail section                          |
| Station 500    | 500               | Tail Reference Point (TRP)            |

## Documentation and Records
