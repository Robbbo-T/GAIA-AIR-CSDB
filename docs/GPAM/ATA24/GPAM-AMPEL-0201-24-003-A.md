# Emergency Power System (Backup Batteries) (S1000D)

**Document Code:** GPAM-AMPEL-0201-24-003-A

## Introduction

The Emergency Power System (EPS) for the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft is designed to provide reliable and efficient backup electrical power to critical aircraft systems in the event of a primary power failure. This document outlines the components, operation, and maintenance procedures for the EPS in accordance with regulatory requirements and manufacturer recommendations.

## System Components

The EPS consists of the following main components:

- Backup batteries
- Battery control units (BCUs)
- Emergency power distribution panels
- Circuit breakers and relays
- Wiring and connectors

## System Operation

The EPS operates by providing backup electrical power to critical aircraft systems in the event of a primary power failure. The backup batteries are the primary source of emergency power, and the BCUs monitor and control the output of the batteries to ensure stable and reliable power supply.

### Normal Operation

During normal operation, the EPS remains in standby mode, with the backup batteries being continuously charged by the primary power generation system. The BCUs monitor the battery status and ensure that the batteries are fully charged and ready for use in an emergency.

### Emergency Operation

In the event of a primary power failure, the EPS is designed to automatically activate and provide emergency power to critical aircraft systems. The BCUs switch the power supply from the primary power generation system to the backup batteries, ensuring that essential systems, such as flight controls, navigation, and communication systems, remain operational.

## Maintenance Procedures

The following sections outline the maintenance procedures for the EPS.

### Routine Inspections

Routine inspections of the EPS should be performed at regular intervals to ensure the continued reliability and performance of the system. The following tasks should be included in routine inspections:

- Visual inspection of backup batteries, BCUs, and emergency power distribution panels
- Check for loose or damaged wiring and connectors
- Inspect and test circuit breakers and relays
- Verify proper operation of the BCUs
- Check for signs of overheating or corrosion

### Scheduled Maintenance

Scheduled maintenance tasks for the EPS should be performed in accordance with the maintenance intervals outlined in the Scheduled Maintenance Program (SMP). The following tasks should be included in scheduled maintenance:

- Replace worn or damaged components (backup batteries, BCUs, etc.)
- Perform functional tests of the EPS
- Update software and firmware for the BCUs
- Conduct non-destructive testing (NDT) of critical components
- Verify proper operation of the emergency power distribution panels

### Troubleshooting

In the event of a malfunction or failure of the EPS, the following troubleshooting steps should be performed:

- Check for tripped circuit breakers or blown fuses
- Inspect wiring and connectors for damage or loose connections
- Test the output of the backup batteries and BCUs
- Verify proper operation of the BCUs
- Consult the aircraft's maintenance manual for additional troubleshooting procedures

## Documentation and Records

All maintenance activities must be documented in the aircraft's maintenance logbook. The following information should be recorded for each maintenance task:

- Date and time of maintenance
- Description of task performed
- Name and signature of technician
- Part numbers and serial numbers of replaced components
- Any discrepancies or issues found and corrective actions taken

## Compliance and Certification

The Emergency Power System complies with the following regulatory requirements and standards:

- Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations
- European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations
- International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards
- Manufacturer's maintenance manual and service bulletins

## Conclusion

The Emergency Power System for the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft is designed to provide reliable and efficient backup electrical power to critical aircraft systems in the event of a primary power failure. By adhering to the maintenance procedures outlined in this document, operators can ensure the continued safety, reliability, and airworthiness of the aircraft.
