# Power Distribution Schematics (S1000D)

**Document Code:** GPAM-AMPEL-0201-24-002-A

## Introduction

The Power Distribution Schematics (PDS) document for the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft provides detailed information about the electrical power distribution system, including schematics, wiring diagrams, and component descriptions. This document is essential for maintenance, troubleshooting, and repair activities, ensuring accurate and efficient power distribution throughout the aircraft.

## System Components

The PDS consists of the following main components:

- Power distribution panels
- Circuit breakers and relays
- Bus bars
- Wiring and connectors
- Load control units (LCUs)
- Grounding points

## System Operation

The power distribution system operates by distributing electrical power from the primary power generation system to various aircraft systems and components. The power distribution panels, circuit breakers, and relays ensure that power is delivered safely and efficiently to all necessary systems.

### Normal Operation

During normal operation, the power distribution system provides electrical power to all aircraft systems. The power distribution panels distribute power from the primary power generation system to various bus bars, which then supply power to individual systems and components. The LCUs monitor and control the power distribution to ensure stable and reliable power supply.

### Emergency Operation

In the event of a power loss or failure, the power distribution system is designed to provide emergency power to critical aircraft systems. The emergency power system, including backup batteries and the auxiliary power unit (APU), is activated to supply power to essential systems, such as flight controls, navigation, and communication systems.

## Maintenance Procedures

The following sections outline the maintenance procedures for the power distribution system.

### Routine Inspections

Routine inspections of the power distribution system should be performed at regular intervals to ensure the continued reliability and performance of the system. The following tasks should be included in routine inspections:

- Visual inspection of power distribution panels, circuit breakers, and relays
- Check for loose or damaged wiring and connectors
- Inspect and test bus bars and grounding points
- Verify proper operation of the LCUs
- Check for signs of overheating or corrosion

### Scheduled Maintenance

Scheduled maintenance tasks for the power distribution system should be performed in accordance with the maintenance intervals outlined in the Scheduled Maintenance Program (SMP). The following tasks should be included in scheduled maintenance:

- Replace worn or damaged components (circuit breakers, relays, etc.)
- Perform functional tests of the power distribution system
- Update software and firmware for the LCUs
- Conduct non-destructive testing (NDT) of critical components
- Verify proper operation of the power distribution panels

### Troubleshooting

In the event of a malfunction or failure of the power distribution system, the following troubleshooting steps should be performed:

- Check for tripped circuit breakers or blown fuses
- Inspect wiring and connectors for damage or loose connections
- Test the output of the power distribution panels and bus bars
- Verify proper operation of the LCUs
- Consult the aircraft's maintenance manual for additional troubleshooting procedures

## Documentation and Records

All maintenance activities must be documented in the aircraft's maintenance logbook. The following information should be recorded for each maintenance task:

- Date and time of maintenance
- Description of task performed
- Name and signature of technician
- Part numbers and serial numbers of replaced components
- Any discrepancies or issues found and corrective actions taken

## Compliance and Certification

The Power Distribution Schematics document complies with the following regulatory requirements and standards:

- Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations
- European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations
- International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards
- Manufacturer's maintenance manual and service bulletins

## Conclusion

The Power Distribution Schematics document for the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft provides essential information for the maintenance, troubleshooting, and repair of the electrical power distribution system. By adhering to the procedures and guidelines outlined in this document, technicians can ensure the continued safety, reliability, and airworthiness of the aircraft.
