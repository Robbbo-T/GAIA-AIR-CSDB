### <a name="41-main-landing-gear-mlg"></a>4.1 Main Landing Gear (MLG)

#### <a name="411-mlg-structural-components"></a>4.1.1 MLG Structural Components

The Main Landing Gear (MLG) assembly is a robust, four-wheel bogie type structure designed for high load bearing and efficient shock absorption. Key structural components include:

*   **Main Fitting/Trunnion (GPAM-LG-MLG-STR-001-A):**  Manufactured from high-strength steel alloy (e.g., 300M steel - GPAM-MAT-300M), the trunnion is a critical load-bearing member that provides a secure and rigid attachment point for the MLG assembly to the wing structure. It is designed to withstand significant shear and bending loads encountered during landing and ground operations.
*   **Shock Strut (GPAM-LG-MLG-STR-002-A):**  An oleo-pneumatic type shock strut is employed for optimal shock absorption. It consists of two telescoping cylinders:
    *   **Outer Cylinder:** Constructed from forged aluminum alloy (e.g., Al 7050-T7451 - GPAM-MAT-7050AL) for lightweight strength.
    *   **Inner Cylinder:**  Made from high-strength steel with a chrome-plated surface for wear resistance and smooth operation.
    *   **Pneumatic Chamber:** Filled with nitrogen and hydraulic fluid to provide combined pneumatic and hydraulic damping.  The charging pressure is specified in GPAM-AMPEL-0201-32-SPEC-001.
*   **Bogie Beam (GPAM-LG-MLG-STR-003-A):**  A lightweight yet rigid beam constructed from titanium alloy (e.g., Ti-6Al-4V - GPAM-MAT-TI64) connects the two wheel axles on each MLG, ensuring even load distribution across the four wheels and enhancing ground stability, particularly on uneven surfaces.
*   **Wheels and Tires (GPAM-LG-MLG-WHL-001-A, GPAM-LG-MLG-TIR-001-A):** Each MLG assembly features four high-speed, tubeless aircraft tires, size 49x17-20, rated for speeds up to 250 knots and pressures up to 220 psi (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-32-SPEC-002).  Wheels are forged aluminum alloy, split-rim design for easy tire changes.
*   **Axles (GPAM-LG-MLG-STR-004-A):** High-strength steel alloy axles are used to support the wheels and brake assemblies.  Axle design incorporates precision bearings for smooth wheel rotation and minimal friction.
*   **Torque Links/Scissors (GPAM-LG-MLG-STR-005-A):**  Robust torque links, often referred to as scissors, made from heat-treated steel, are implemented to prevent relative rotation between the inner and outer cylinders of the shock strut during compression and extension cycles, ensuring controlled and predictable shock absorption.
*   **Braces/Drag Struts (GPAM-LG-MLG-STR-006-A, GPAM-LG-MLG-STR-007-A):**  Forward and aft drag struts, typically manufactured from high-strength aluminum alloy, provide crucial longitudinal stability and bracing to the MLG assembly, particularly during landing and braking forces.

#### <a name="412-mlg-extensionretraction-mechanism"></a>4.1.2 MLG Extension/Retraction Mechanism

*   **Sequencing System (GPAM-LG-MLG-CTL-SEQ-001-A):**  The extension/retraction sequence is managed by the Landing Gear Control Unit (LGCU) (GPAM-LG-CTL-LGCU-001-A). The LGCU utilizes inputs from flight control levers, proximity sensors, limit switches, and aircraft state data (e.g., airspeed, altitude, weight-on-wheels) to control hydraulic valves (GPAM-LG-VALVE-HYD-001-A) and manage the sequence logically.
*   **Emergency Extension System (GPAM-LG-MLG-EXT-EMER-001-A):** A dedicated emergency extension system provides a backup in case of primary hydraulic system failure. This system utilizes a **free-fall** mechanism. Upon activation of the emergency gear lever in the cockpit, hydraulic pressure is released from the retraction actuators and uplocks, allowing gravity and airflow to deploy the landing gear.  Mechanical stops ensure secure extension and downlocking.

#### <a name="413-mlg-shock-absorption"></a>4.1.3 MLG Shock Absorption

The MLG shock absorption system is based on oleo-pneumatic struts, providing effective energy dissipation and damping:

*   **Type of Shock Strut (GPAM-LG-MLG-STR-002-A):** Oleo-pneumatic, self-centering type.
*   **Working Principle:**  The oleo-pneumatic strut operates by utilizing the compressibility of nitrogen gas and the controlled flow of hydraulic fluid through an orifice within the strut.
    *   **Landing Impact:** Upon landing impact, the inner cylinder telescopes into the outer cylinder. This action compresses the nitrogen gas in the upper chamber, absorbing a significant portion of the impact energy as potential energy. Simultaneously, hydraulic fluid is forced through a calibrated orifice from the lower chamber to the upper chamber.
    *   **Energy Dissipation:**  The restricted flow of hydraulic fluid through the orifice creates damping.  Friction within the orifice and viscous dissipation of the fluid convert kinetic energy into heat, effectively damping oscillations and preventing bouncing.
*   **Damping Mechanism:** Hydraulic damping, achieved through a variable orifice within the shock strut. The orifice size may be fixed or variable depending on the sophistication of the design. For the AMPEL360XWLRGA, a fixed orifice is used, optimized for typical landing conditions.
*   **Performance Characteristics (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-32-SPEC-003):**
    *   **Stroke Length:**  350 mm
    *   **Maximum Load (per strut):**  150,000 kg
    *   **Damping Ratio:**  0.7 (critically damped to minimize oscillations).
    *   **Nitrogen Pre-charge Pressure:**  1800 psi at 20°C (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-32-AMM Appendix A for charging procedures).

### <a name="44-braking-system"></a>4.4 Braking System

The AMPEL360XWLRGA braking system is a sophisticated system incorporating normal braking, anti-skid, autobrakes, and parking brake functionalities.

#### <a name="441-normal-braking"></a>4.4.1 Normal Braking

The normal braking system provides proportional braking control via pilot input:

*   **Type of Brakes (GPAM-LG-MLG-BRK-001-A):** Carbon brakes (described in 4.1.4).
*   **Brake Actuation (GPAM-LG-BRK-ACT-001-A):** Hydraulic actuation.  Hydraulic pressure is supplied from the aircraft's primary hydraulic system (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-29-001-A).
*   **Brake Control System (GPAM-LG-BRK-CTL-001-A):**
    *   **Brake Pedals:**  Located at the pilot and co-pilot stations.  Depressing the brake pedals proportionally controls hydraulic pressure to the brakes. Pedal force transducers (GPAM-LG-SEN-FORCE-PEDAL-001-A) provide electrical signals representing pedal input.
    *   **Brake Control Valves (GPAM-LG-VALVE-BRK-CTL-001-A):**  Electrically controlled hydraulic servo valves modulate hydraulic pressure to each MLG brake assembly based on pedal input and anti-skid system commands.

#### <a name="442-anti-skid-system"></a>4.4.2 Anti-Skid System

The anti-skid system prevents wheel lockup and optimizes braking performance, particularly on slippery runways:

*   **Purpose:** To prevent wheel lockup during braking, maximizing braking efficiency and maintaining directional control by preventing skidding.
*   **Operating Principle:**  The anti-skid system continuously monitors wheel speed and deceleration.  If it detects impending wheel lockup (rapid deceleration or wheel speed approaching zero), it automatically reduces brake pressure to that wheel to allow it to regain speed.  Brake pressure is then reapplied, modulated to remain just below the skid threshold.
*   **Components (GPAM-LG-BRK-ASKID-COMP-001-A):**
    *   **Wheel Speed Sensors (GPAM-LG-SEN-SPEED-WHL-001-A):**  Magnetic pulse wheel speed sensors are installed on each MLG wheel axle to provide continuous wheel speed data to the Anti-Skid Control Unit (ASCU).
    *   **Anti-Skid Control Unit (ASCU) (GPAM-LG-CTL-ASKID-001-A):**  A dedicated electronic control unit that processes wheel speed data, detects skid conditions, and generates commands to modulate brake pressure via the brake control valves.
    *   **Brake Control Valves (GPAM-LG-VALVE-BRK-CTL-001-A):**  (Shared with normal braking system) Electrically controlled hydraulic servo valves respond to ASCU commands to adjust brake pressure.
*   **Interface with Braking System:** The anti-skid system is integral to the normal braking system, acting as a closed-loop control system that overrides pilot brake pedal input when necessary to prevent skids.

#### <a name="443-autobrakes"></a>4.4.3 Autobrakes

The autobrake system provides automatic, controlled deceleration during landing and rejected takeoff (RTO):

*   **Purpose:**  To automatically apply brakes during landing rollout or in the event of a rejected takeoff, reducing pilot workload and ensuring consistent deceleration performance.
*   **Modes of Operation (GPAM-LG-BRK-AUTO-MODES-001-A):**
    *   **RTO (Rejected Takeoff):**  Activated automatically during a rejected takeoff initiated by thrust lever retraction above a predefined speed. Applies maximum braking effort for rapid deceleration.
    *   **LAND (Landing):**  Pilot selectable settings (e.g., LOW, MED, MAX) provide pre-set deceleration rates during landing rollout.  Autobrakes engage automatically upon touchdown, as sensed by weight-on-wheels sensors.
*   **Control Logic (GPAM-LG-BRK-AUTO-LOGIC-001-A):** Implemented within the Autobrake Control Unit (ABCU) (GPAM-LG-CTL-AUTO-BRK-001-A).  The ABCU receives inputs from:
    *   **Weight-on-Wheels (WOW) sensors (GPAM-LG-SEN-WOW-001-A):** To detect touchdown for LAND mode activation.
    *   **Thrust Lever Position Sensors (GPAM-ENG-CTL-THRUST-SEN-001-A):** To detect thrust lever retraction for RTO mode activation.
    *   **Airspeed Sensor (GPAM-AD-SEN-AIRSPD-001-A):** To verify aircraft speed for RTO activation and LAND mode deceleration profiles.
    *   **Autobrake Selector Switch (GPAM-LG-LGCIS-PNL-001-A):**  Pilot selects LAND modes (LOW, MED, MAX).
*   **Interface with Flight Control System:**  Autobrake system operation and status may be annunciated on the Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) (GPAM-EFIS-DISP-001-A).  The Flight Management System (FMS) (GPAM-FMS-CORE-001-A) may provide data for optimized autobrake performance.
