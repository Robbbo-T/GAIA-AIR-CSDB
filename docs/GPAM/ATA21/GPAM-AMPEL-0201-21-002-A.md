## 3. System Overview and Architecture

### 3.1 System Overview

The Cabin Temperature Control System (CTCS) is an integrated, fully automatic system designed to maintain a comfortable and consistent cabin temperature for passengers and crew on the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft. It utilizes feedback from multiple temperature sensors to regulate the flow of conditioned air into the cabin. The *primary* source of conditioned air is the Atmospheric Energy Harvesting and Conversion System (AEHCS), minimizing reliance on traditional bleed air systems and improving overall aircraft efficiency. The CTCS is controlled by a dedicated Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and interfaces with the aircraft's Central Maintenance Computer (CMC) for monitoring, diagnostics, and fault reporting.

### 3.2 Functional Description

The CTCS operates as a closed-loop control system. Here's a breakdown of its operation:

1.  **Temperature Sensing:** Temperature sensors, strategically located throughout the cabin and in the air distribution ducts, provide real-time temperature readings to the ECU.

2.  **Setpoint Comparison:** The ECU compares these readings to the desired temperature setpoint (selected by the pilot on the instrument panel – see GPAM-AMPEL-0201-31-002-A).

3.  **Control Signal Calculation:** The ECU calculates the necessary adjustments to the Hot Air Control Valve (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-21-CTV-001-P) and Cold Air Control Valve (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-21-CTV-002-P) to achieve the desired supply air temperature.

4.  **Valve Actuation:** The ECU sends control signals to the valves, modulating the flow of hot and cold air from the AEHCS.

5.  **Air Mixing:** The Hot and Cold Air Control Valves feed into the Air Mix Valve (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-21-AMV-001-P), which blends the air streams to achieve the precise temperature required.

6.  **Air Distribution:** The conditioned air is then distributed throughout the cabin via the Air Distribution System (ducts and diffusers).

7.  **Recirculation:** Recirculation fans enhance air circulation and ensure even temperature distribution within the cabin.

8.  **Fault Management:** The ECU performs continuous fault detection. Any detected faults are logged to the CMC (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-45-001).

## 3. System Overview and Architecture

### 3.1 System Overview

The Cabin Temperature Control System (CTCS) is an integrated, fully automatic system designed to maintain a comfortable and consistent cabin temperature for passengers and crew on the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft. It utilizes feedback from multiple temperature sensors to regulate the flow of conditioned air into the cabin. The *primary* source of conditioned air is the Atmospheric Energy Harvesting and Conversion System (AEHCS), minimizing reliance on traditional bleed air systems and improving overall aircraft efficiency. The CTCS is controlled by a dedicated Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and interfaces with the aircraft's Central Maintenance Computer (CMC) for monitoring, diagnostics, and fault reporting.

The CTCS operates as a closed-loop control system. Here's a breakdown of its operation:

1.  **Temperature Sensing:** Temperature sensors, strategically located throughout the cabin and in the air distribution ducts, provide real-time temperature readings to the ECU.

2.  **Setpoint Comparison:** The ECU compares these readings to the desired temperature setpoint (selected by the pilot on the instrument panel – see GPAM-AMPEL-0201-31-002-A).

3.  **Control Signal Calculation:** The ECU calculates the necessary adjustments to the Hot Air Control Valve (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-21-CTV-001-P) and Cold Air Control Valve (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-21-CTV-002-P) to achieve the desired supply air temperature.

4.  **Valve Actuation:** The ECU sends control signals to the valves, modulating the flow of hot and cold air from the AEHCS.

## 5. System Operation

The Cabin Temperature Control System (CTCS) is designed for fully automatic operation with minimal crew intervention.  This section describes the operational modes and sequences of the CTCS.

### 5.1 Startup Mode

The CTCS initiates operation automatically upon aircraft power-up. The startup sequence is as follows:

1.  **Power Application:**  When aircraft power is applied (Primary Power Generation System - GPAM-AMPEL-0201-24-001-A), the CTCS ECU is energized.

2.  **Self-Test:** The ECU performs a power-on self-test (POST). This includes checks of:
    *   ECU processor and memory integrity.
    *   Communication interfaces (CAN bus, ARINC 429, Ethernet).
    *   Sensor input circuits (open/short circuit detection).
    *   Valve control output circuits.
    *   Internal software checksum verification.

3.  **Initialization:** Upon successful POST, the ECU initializes:
    *   Control algorithms and parameters (loading default or last saved settings from non-volatile memory).
    *   Temperature sensor readings (establishing baseline values).
    *   Valve positions (initially setting valves to a default position, typically closed or minimally open).
    *   Communication with the CMC (establishing data link for monitoring and fault reporting).

4.  **Mode Selection:** The CTCS enters 'Standby' mode initially. It will transition to 'Normal Operation' mode once a cabin temperature setpoint is received (either pre-programmed or manually set by the pilot via the instrument panel).

5.  **Fault Reporting:** If any faults are detected during POST or initialization, the ECU:
    *   Sets a fault flag internally.
    *   Transmits a fault message to the CMC (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-45-001).
    *   May inhibit CTCS operation depending on the severity of the fault (fail-safe behavior).

### 5.2 Normal Operation Mode

In Normal Operation mode, the CTCS actively regulates cabin temperature to maintain the desired setpoint. The operational sequence is as follows, repeating continuously at a control loop frequency of [Placeholder: e.g., 10 Hz]:

1.  **Sensor Data Acquisition:** The ECU reads data from all cabin and duct temperature sensors. Raw sensor data is validated (see Section 5.5 for Data Validation).

2.  **Temperature Averaging and Filtering:** Sensor readings are averaged and digitally filtered to reduce noise and provide a stable temperature indication for control. [Placeholder: Specify filter type and parameters, e.g., Moving Average Filter, Kalman Filter].

3.  **Error Calculation:** The ECU calculates the temperature error as the difference between the desired temperature setpoint and the current cabin temperature (average of cabin sensors).

4.  **Control Algorithm Execution:** The ECU executes the temperature control algorithm (see Section 6. Control Logic) to determine the required adjustments to the Hot Air Control Valve and Cold Air Control Valve positions.

5.  **Valve Control Signal Output:**  The ECU outputs analog control signals (4-20 mA) to the Hot Air Control Valve and Cold Air Control Valve. These signals proportionally control the valve opening to regulate airflow.

6.  **System Monitoring:**  During normal operation, the ECU continuously monitors:
    *   Sensor readings (for out-of-range values, signal degradation).
    *   Valve actuator currents (for actuator faults, valve sticking).
    *   ECU internal temperature and voltage (for ECU health monitoring).
    *   Communication link integrity with CMC.

7.  **Fault Detection and Response:**  If any faults are detected during normal operation, the ECU:
    *   Sets a fault flag internally.
    *   Transmits a fault message to the CMC.
    *   Initiates appropriate fault response actions (see Section 5.4 Failure Modes).

### 5.3 Shutdown Mode

The CTCS enters Shutdown mode when aircraft power is removed. The shutdown sequence is as follows:

1.  **Power Loss Detection:** The ECU detects loss of primary power.

2.  **Valve Shutdown:**  The ECU immediately commands the Hot Air Control Valve and Cold Air Control Valve to the fail-safe closed position. This ensures that conditioned air flow is stopped when the system is not powered.

3.  **Data Storage (If Time Permits):** If sufficient power резерв is available (e.g., from a capacitor or internal battery – [Placeholder: To be determined if necessary]), the ECU attempts to save current operational parameters and fault logs to non-volatile memory for later retrieval.

4.  **Power Down:** The ECU powers down its internal components in a controlled manner.

### 5.4 Failure Modes

The CTCS is designed with fail-safe principles in mind.  In case of failures, the system is designed to revert to a safe state, and faults are reported to the CMC.  Key failure modes and responses include:

| Failure Mode                                    | Detection Method                                   | Response Action                                                                                                          | Fault Reporting to CMC |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| **ECU Failure**                                 | Self-test failure, watchdog timer timeout, comms loss | System shutdown, valves fail-safe closed. No active temperature control.                                                 | Yes                      |
| **Temperature Sensor Failure (Cabin or Duct)** | Out-of-range reading, signal degradation, no signal | ECU uses readings from remaining sensors (if multiple). If all sensors fail, CTCS may revert to a default operating mode. | Yes                      |
| **Hot Air Control Valve Failure**               | Actuator current out of range, valve position feedback mismatch | ECU attempts to control with Cold Air Valve only. If full control loss, valves fail-safe closed.                      | Yes                      |
| **Cold Air Control Valve Failure**              | Actuator current out of range, valve position feedback mismatch | ECU attempts to control with Hot Air Valve only. If full control loss, valves fail-safe closed.                      | Yes                      |
| **Air Mix Valve Failure**                         | Actuator current out of range, valve position feedback mismatch | CTCS may be able to maintain temperature using Hot and Cold Air Valves, but mixing precision may be reduced.           | Yes                      |
| **Communication Bus Failure (CAN/ARINC 429)** | Loss of communication with CMC or other systems     | Limited fault reporting. May affect ability to receive setpoint commands from other systems.                              | Yes (if possible)        |
| **Power Supply Failure**                         | Under-voltage, over-voltage                         | System shutdown, valves fail-safe closed.                                                                              | Yes (if possible)        |

*Note: This is a preliminary failure modes list. A full Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) will be conducted during detailed design - See GPAM-AMPEL-0201-21-FMEA-001-A (Placeholder).*

### 5.5 Data Validation

To ensure reliable operation, the ECU performs data validation on sensor inputs and internal data. Validation methods include:

*   **Range Checking:** Sensor readings are checked to be within their defined operating ranges (e.g., temperature sensors between -50°C and +85°C). Readings outside the valid range are flagged as invalid and not used for control calculations.
*   **Rate of Change Monitoring:**  Excessively rapid changes in sensor readings are flagged as potentially invalid, indicating a sensor fault or transient noise. [Placeholder: Define acceptable rate of change limits].
*   **Sensor Cross-Comparison:** Readings from redundant or geographically close sensors are compared. Significant discrepancies between readings may indicate a fault in one or more sensors. [Placeholder: Define acceptable discrepancy thresholds].
*   **CRC Checks:** Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC) are used to verify the integrity of data received over communication interfaces (CAN bus, ARINC 429, Ethernet). Corrupted data packets are discarded and re-transmission may be requested (if protocol supports it).
*   **Software Checksums:**  Software checksums are used to periodically verify the integrity of the ECU’s program memory and configuration data.

## 6. Control Logic

The CTCS Electronic Control Unit (ECU) employs a closed-loop Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithm to regulate cabin temperature. The PID algorithm was selected for its robust performance, ease of tuning, and wide applicability in aerospace temperature control systems.

### 6.1 Control Algorithm Overview

The ECU implements a discrete-time PID control algorithm. The control output, which determines the valve positions, is calculated based on the current temperature error, the integral of past errors, and the rate of change of the error.

The control objective is to minimize the error (*e(t)*) between the desired cabin temperature setpoint (*T_setpoint*) and the measured cabin temperature (*T_cabin(t)*):

*e(t) = T_setpoint - T_cabin(t)*

The control signal (*u(t)*) – representing the combined commanded opening percentage for the Hot Air and Cold Air Control Valves – is calculated as:

*u(t) = Kp \* e(t) + Ki \* ∫e(t)dt + Kd \* de(t)/dt*

In discrete-time form, suitable for ECU implementation, this becomes:

*u[k] = Kp \* e[k] + Ki \* Ts \* ∑_{i=0}^{k} e[i] + Kd \* (e[k] - e[k-1]) / Ts*

Where:

*   *u[k]* is the control signal at time step *k*.
*   *e[k]* is the error at time step *k*.
*   *Kp* is the Proportional gain.
*   *Ki* is the Integral gain.
*   *Kd* is the Derivative gain.
*   *Ts* is the sampling time (control loop period) in seconds.
*   *∑_{i=0}^{k} e[i]* is the discrete-time integral of the error.
*   *(e[k] - e[k-1]) / Ts* is the discrete-time derivative of the error.

### 6.2 Gain Scheduling

To optimize performance across different operating conditions (e.g., cruise altitude, ambient temperature variations), the PID gains (*Kp*, *Ki*, *Kd*) may be adjusted based on a gain scheduling approach.  Gain scheduling involves changing the PID gains based on pre-determined operating parameters.

Potential gain scheduling parameters for the CTCS include:

*   **Ambient Temperature:** Measured by [Placeholder: Specify Ambient Temperature Sensor if applicable, or derived from Avionics data].  Gains may be adjusted to account for varying heat loads into the cabin.
*   **Altitude:** Derived from Avionics data (ARINC 429 interface). Gains may be adjusted to account for changes in air density and thermal characteristics at different altitudes.
*   **Cabin Occupancy (Optional):** [Placeholder: If cabin occupancy sensor is implemented] Gains may be adjusted to account for heat generated by passengers.

The gain scheduling logic will be implemented as a lookup table or a set of pre-defined gain sets for different operating regimes. [Placeholder: Detail gain scheduling lookup table or rules].

### 6.3 Valve Control Signal Mapping

The calculated control signal *u[k]* (a dimensionless percentage from 0-100%) needs to be mapped to individual control signals for the Hot Air Control Valve and Cold Air Control Valve.  A mixing strategy will be implemented:

*   **Baseline Cold Air:**  The Cold Air Control Valve will be the primary valve for temperature reduction. Its control signal (*u_cold*) will be directly proportional to the negative portion of the control signal *u[k]*.  *u_cold = max(0, -u[k])*.  Mapped to a 4-20mA signal for the Cold Air Valve.

*   **Hot Air Trim:** The Hot Air Control Valve will be used for fine-tuning and temperature increase. Its control signal (*u_hot*) will be proportional to the positive portion of the control signal *u[k]*, but potentially with a reduced gain to provide finer control and prevent overshoot. *u_hot = max(0, K_hot \* u[k])*, where *K_hot* is a gain factor between 0 and 1 [Placeholder: Determine optimal K_hot value]. Mapped to a 4-20mA signal for the Hot Air Valve.

*   **Air Mix Valve Control:**  The Air Mix Valve will be controlled via Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). The PWM duty cycle will be determined based on the control signal *u[k]*, potentially using a non-linear mapping to optimize mixing efficiency. [Placeholder: Define PWM control strategy for Air Mix Valve].  In simpler implementations, the Air Mix Valve might be set to a fixed position and only the Hot and Cold Air Valves used for dynamic control. [Placeholder: Define if Air Mix Valve is dynamically controlled or fixed].

### 6.4 PID Gain Tuning and Stability

The PID gains (*Kp*, *Ki*, *Kd*) will be determined through a combination of:

*   **System Modeling and Simulation:**  A dynamic model of the cabin thermal environment and the CTCS will be developed to simulate system response and initially tune the PID gains. [Placeholder: Reference to system modeling document - e.g., GPAM-AMPEL-0201-21-MODEL-001-A].
*   **Bench Testing:**  Prototype CTCS components will be tested in a controlled thermal chamber to experimentally refine the PID gains and validate the simulation model.
*   **Flight Testing:** Final PID gain tuning and validation will be performed during flight tests under various operational conditions.

System stability analysis will be conducted to ensure that the closed-loop control system is stable across the operating envelope and with the selected PID gains and gain scheduling strategy.  [Placeholder: Reference to stability analysis report - e.g., GPAM-AMPEL-0201-21-STAB-001-A].

## 10. Safety Considerations

The Cabin Temperature Control System (CTCS) is designed with several safety features to ensure safe and reliable operation.  Safety considerations are paramount in airborne systems, and the CTCS design incorporates multiple layers of safety provisions.

### 10.1 Fail-Safe Design

*   **Valve Fail-Safe Position:**  The Hot Air Control Valve and Cold Air Control Valve are designed to fail-safe to the closed position upon loss of power or control signal. This ensures that in case of CTCS malfunction, conditioned airflow is stopped, preventing uncontrolled temperature excursions in the cabin and reverting to a passive ventilation state.

*   **ECU Redundancy (Placeholder):** [Placeholder: Describe redundancy implementation if applicable - e.g., "The ECU incorporates dual-redundant processing channels with automatic failover. In case of a primary ECU failure, the secondary ECU automatically takes over control, ensuring continued CTCS operation with minimal interruption."]  If redundancy is not implemented, state: "The ECU is designed for high reliability, but does not incorporate full redundancy. ECU failure will result in loss of active temperature control. Fail-safe valve positions are maintained upon ECU failure."

*   **Over-Temperature Protection (ECU):** The ECU incorporates internal temperature sensors and over-temperature protection circuits. If the ECU internal temperature exceeds safe limits, the ECU will initiate a controlled shutdown to prevent component damage and potential fire hazards.

### 10.2 Software Safety

*   **DO-178C Compliance:**  The CTCS ECU software is designed and developed in accordance with DO-178C guidelines for airborne software, targeting Design Assurance Level (DAL) C. This includes rigorous software development processes, requirements traceability, code reviews, and extensive testing to minimize software defects and ensure predictable and safe operation.  [Placeholder: Reference Software Development and Verification Plan - GPAM-AMPEL-0201-21-SWVP-001-A].

*   **Software Fault Detection:**  The ECU software incorporates fault detection routines to monitor for software errors, memory corruption, and algorithm anomalies. Detected software faults will trigger fault handling routines and reporting to the CMC.

*   **Watchdog Timer:** A hardware watchdog timer is implemented in the ECU to monitor software execution. If the software fails to refresh the watchdog timer within a specified timeframe (indicating a software lockup or failure), the watchdog timer will trigger a hardware reset of the ECU, forcing a system restart to recover from potential software malfunctions.

### 10.3 Environmental and Operational Safety

*   **DO-160G Environmental Qualification:**  CTCS components (ECU, valves, sensors) are designed and tested to meet the environmental requirements of DO-160G for airborne equipment. This includes testing for temperature extremes, altitude, vibration, humidity, shock, and electromagnetic interference (EMI/EMC) to ensure reliable operation in the harsh aerospace environment.  [Placeholder: Reference DO-160G Compliance Test Report - GPAM-AMPEL-0201-21-D160G-RPT-001-A].

*   **Flammability and Smoke Emission:** Materials used in CTCS components, especially those located within the cabin air circulation path (ducting, valves), are selected to be compliant with aerospace flammability and smoke emission standards (e.g., FAR 25.853).

*   **Electrical Bonding and Grounding:** Proper electrical bonding and grounding techniques are implemented throughout the CTCS installation to minimize EMI/EMC susceptibility and mitigate potential lightning strike effects.

*   **Wiring and Circuit Protection:** Aircraft-grade wiring and connectors are used throughout the CTCS. Circuits are protected with appropriate circuit breakers or fuses to prevent overcurrent and potential fire hazards.

### 10.4 Maintenance Safety

*   **Safety Procedures in Maintenance Manuals:**  Detailed maintenance procedures in the CTCS maintenance manuals (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-21-AMM-XXXX-A) will include specific safety precautions for maintenance personnel, including procedures for de-energizing the system, handling components, and performing tests safely.

*   **Lockout/Tagout Procedures:**  Lockout/tagout procedures will be defined for maintenance tasks requiring system de-energization to prevent accidental re-energization during maintenance.
