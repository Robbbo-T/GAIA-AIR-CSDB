# AEHCS System Overview and Architecture (S1000D)

**Document Code:** GPAM-AMPEL-0201-28-Q1-001-A

## Introduction

The Alternative Energy Harvesting and Control System (AEHCS) for the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft is designed to harness and manage alternative energy sources to enhance the aircraft's efficiency and reduce its environmental impact. This document provides an overview of the AEHCS, including its components, architecture, and operation.

## Overview

The AEHCS integrates multiple alternative energy harvesting technologies, including triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), piezoelectric energy harvesters, and concave solar panels. The system is designed to capture and convert ambient energy into electrical power, which is then stored and managed for use by the aircraft's systems.

### Key Components

The following sections provide an overview of the key components of the AEHCS.

#### Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs)

TENGs are devices that generate electrical power through the triboelectric effect, which occurs when two materials come into contact and then separate, creating a charge imbalance. The AEHCS utilizes TENGs to capture mechanical energy from vibrations, airflow, and other sources.

#### Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters

Piezoelectric energy harvesters generate electrical power by converting mechanical stress into electrical energy. The AEHCS incorporates piezoelectric materials in various locations on the aircraft to capture energy from structural vibrations, aerodynamic forces, and other mechanical sources.

#### Concave Solar Panels

Concave solar panels are designed to capture solar energy more efficiently by focusing sunlight onto photovoltaic cells. The AEHCS integrates concave solar panels on the aircraft's surface to maximize solar energy harvesting.

## Architecture

The AEHCS architecture is designed to efficiently capture, convert, store, and manage alternative energy sources. The following sections provide an overview of the system architecture.

### Energy Harvesting Modules

The energy harvesting modules include TENGs, piezoelectric energy harvesters, and concave solar panels. These modules are strategically placed on the aircraft to capture ambient energy from various sources.

### Energy Conversion and Storage

The energy conversion and storage subsystem is responsible for converting the harvested energy into electrical power and storing it in the aircraft's battery system. This subsystem includes power converters, charge controllers, and energy storage devices.

### Energy Management and Control

The energy management and control subsystem is responsible for monitoring and managing the flow of energy within the AEHCS. This subsystem includes control algorithms, sensors, and communication interfaces to ensure efficient energy utilization and distribution.

## System Operation

The AEHCS operates automatically, with real-time monitoring and control to optimize energy harvesting and utilization. The following sections outline the normal operation and emergency procedures for the AEHCS.

### Normal Operation

During normal operation, the AEHCS continuously captures and converts ambient energy into electrical power. The energy management and control subsystem monitors the energy flow and ensures efficient distribution to the aircraft's systems. The battery system stores excess energy for later use.

### Emergency Procedures

In the event of an AEHCS malfunction, the following emergency procedures should be followed:

1. Identify the affected component and isolate it using the appropriate control interface.
2. Monitor the energy flow and ensure that critical systems receive sufficient power.
3. If necessary, switch to backup power sources to maintain system operation.
4. Document the malfunction and take corrective actions as necessary.

## Documentation and Records

All maintenance activities related to the AEHCS must be documented in the aircraft's maintenance logbook. The following information should be recorded for each maintenance task:

- Date and time of maintenance
- Description of task performed
- Name and signature of technician
- Part numbers and serial numbers of replaced components
- Any discrepancies or issues found and corrective actions taken

## Compliance and Certification

The AEHCS System Overview and Architecture document complies with the following regulatory requirements and standards:

- Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations
- European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations
- International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards
- Manufacturer's maintenance manual and service bulletins

## Conclusion

The AEHCS System Overview and Architecture document provides essential information for understanding the design, components, and operation of the AEHCS for the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft.
