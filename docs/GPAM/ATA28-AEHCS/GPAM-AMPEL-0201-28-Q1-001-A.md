## 3. System Architecture

The AEHCS architecture is designed for modularity, scalability, and efficient energy flow management. The system is conceptually divided into three main subsystems:

## 4. System Operation

The AEHCS operates largely autonomously, with minimal pilot interaction required during normal flight operations.

### 4.1 Normal Operation

*   **Energy Harvesting Phase (Continuous during Operation):** Throughout all phases of flight and even during ground operations with sufficient sunlight or ambient vibration, the Energy Harvesting Modules (EHMs) continuously capture ambient energy from TENGs, Piezoelectric harvesters, and Concave Solar Panels.  The harvested energy output varies dynamically based on flight conditions (airspeed, altitude, turbulence, solar irradiance, time of day/year, etc.).
*   **Energy Conversion and Aggregation (ECM Operation):**  The Energy Control Module (ECM) continuously monitors the power output from all EHMs. It converts the harvested energy to a suitable DC voltage level and aggregates it. The ECM optimizes power conversion efficiency based on input power levels and load demands.
*   **Energy Storage (ESS Charging):**  The ECM directs the converted harvested energy to charge the Energy Storage System (ESS).  The ECM implements intelligent charge control algorithms to maximize charging efficiency and prevent overcharging the ESS. The ESS stores excess harvested energy for later use when harvesting rates are lower or load demands are higher.
*   **Energy Distribution and Load Serving:** The ECM dynamically distributes harvested energy to designated auxiliary loads within the aircraft. Load prioritization logic ensures that critical auxiliary systems receive power first.  Excess harvested energy, if available, may be used for trickle charging the main aircraft batteries (EPS integration TBD).
*   **System Monitoring and Display:**  The ECM continuously monitors AEHCS performance and health.  Key parameters such as harvested power levels, ESS State-of-Charge (SoC), and system status are displayed on the Flight Deck Display System (FDDS) for pilot awareness (AEHCS system page or integrated into Electrical System display - TBD).  Faults and warnings are annunciated via EICAS messages.
*   **Interaction with Electrical Power System (EPS):** [Placeholder: Detail the interaction with the main Electrical Power System (EPS) - e.g., AEHCS operates in parallel with EPS, provides supplementary power,  EPS is the primary power source, AEHCS supplements it].  Specify how harvested energy is integrated into the EPS power distribution network.  Synchronization and voltage regulation aspects of EPS integration.

### 4.2 Emergency Procedures

In the event of an AEHCS malfunction, the system is designed to fail gracefully and not negatively impact primary aircraft systems. Pilot procedures are designed to be simple and primarily focused on awareness and monitoring.

1.  **Fault Identification (EICAS Annunciation):** AEHCS faults are annunciated to the pilot via EICAS messages. [Placeholder: Specify EICAS message examples for AEHCS faults - e.g., "AEHCS ECM FAIL," "AEHCS ESS FAULT," "AEHCS TENG MODULE OFFLINE"].  EICAS messages will indicate the type and severity of the fault.
2.  **Monitor AEHCS Status on FDDS:** The pilot should monitor the AEHCS system page (or integrated electrical system page) on the FDDS to assess the overall status of the AEHCS, harvested power levels, and ESS State-of-Charge.
3.  **No Immediate Pilot Action Required for Most Faults:**  In most AEHCS malfunction scenarios (e.g., failure of a single EHM, minor ECM fault, degradation of solar panel performance), **no immediate pilot action is required**. The AEHCS is designed as a supplementary system, and its loss will not compromise primary aircraft functions or flight safety. The primary electrical power system (EPS) will continue to supply power to all essential aircraft systems.
4.  **ECM Failover (Automatic - if applicable):** If a Primary ECM failure is detected, the system is designed for automatic failover to the Secondary ECM (if dual-redundant ECM is implemented).  Failover should be seamless and transparent to the pilot, except for a potential EICAS advisory message indicating ECM failover.
5.  **Isolate Faulty Component (Maintenance Action - Post Flight):**  For maintenance purposes, fault isolation procedures will be detailed in the AEHCS Troubleshooting Manual (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-29-TSM-001-A). Ground maintenance personnel will use the Autopilot System Diagnostic Tool (GPAM-AMPEL-45-GSE-003-A) to retrieve detailed fault logs from the ECM and identify the faulty component (EHM, ECM, ESS, sensor). Replacement of faulty components will be performed as per the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) - [Placeholder: Reference AMM Sections for AEHCS components].
6.  **Emergency Power Switch (None - AEHCS is supplementary):**  There is **no dedicated emergency power switch to manually disconnect the AEHCS**.  The AEHCS is designed to be a non-critical, supplementary system.  In case of a severe AEHCS malfunction that *could* potentially interfere with other systems (highly unlikely scenario, mitigated by system design and safety features), the primary electrical power system disconnect procedures (defined in GPAM-AMPEL-0201-25-001-A, Electrical Power System Description) would be the primary means of isolating electrical systems.  However, specific AEHCS disconnect procedures for maintenance purposes will be defined in the AMM.

## 5. Documentation and Records

## 9. Safety Features

The AMPEL360XWLRGA AEHCS incorporates multiple safety features:

*   **Overcharge and Over-Discharge Protection (ESS):**  Integrated Battery Management System (BMS) within the ESS provides robust overcharge and over-discharge protection for the battery cells, preventing damage and thermal runaway.
*   **Thermal Runaway Protection (ESS):**  BMS includes temperature monitoring and control to prevent thermal runaway of the ESS battery.  Passive or active cooling mechanisms (TBD - specify cooling method) to maintain battery temperature within safe limits.  Cell-level safety features within battery cells (e.g., thermal fuses, vents).
*   **Short Circuit Protection (System-wide):**  Fuses and circuit breakers are incorporated throughout the AEHCS power distribution network to protect against short circuits and overcurrent conditions.  Fault current limiting circuits in the ECM.
*   **Overvoltage Protection (ECM and EHMs):**  Overvoltage protection circuitry in the ECM and within EHMs to protect components from voltage spikes and surges from energy harvesting sources or the EPS.
*   **Fault Detection and Isolation (BITE):**  Comprehensive Built-In Test Equipment (BITE) within the ECM continuously monitors AEHCS component health, sensor validity, and system performance.  BITE detects faults and provides fault annunciation via EICAS and fault logging for maintenance.  Fault isolation capabilities to pinpoint faulty modules for efficient maintenance.
*   **Modular and Distributed Architecture:**  The modular and distributed architecture of the AEHCS inherently limits the impact of a single point failure. Failure of one EHM or even one ECM channel (in redundant ECM design) will not cause a catastrophic system failure or loss of primary aircraft functions.
*   **Structural Integrity and Mounting:**  EHMs and solar panels are designed for robust structural integrity and secure mounting to the aircraft structure to withstand aerodynamic loads, vibration, and other environmental stresses.  Mounting hardware and installation procedures compliant with aerospace standards.  Structural analysis reports for EHM and solar panel installations [Placeholder: Reference Structural Analysis Reports for EHM and Solar Panel Mounting].
*   **Lightning Strike Protection:** Externally mounted EHMs and solar panels and associated wiring are designed and shielded to withstand and mitigate the effects of lightning strikes, complying with DO-160G Section 22 and SAE ARP5416 lightning protection guidelines.
