# Secondary Flight Control System Description (S1000D)

**Document Code:** GPAM-AMPEL-0201-28-001-A

## 1. Introduction

The Secondary Flight Control System (SFCS) of the AMPEL360XLRGA aircraft is an integral part of its advanced flight control architecture. Working in conjunction with the Primary Flight Control System (PFCS) and the Fly-by-Wire (FBW) system, the SFCS enhances aircraft performance and control authority, particularly during critical flight phases such as takeoff, landing, and maneuvering.  This document details the components, operation, maintenance, and safety aspects of the AMPEL360XLRGA SFCS, providing a comprehensive reference for engineering, maintenance, and operational personnel. The SFCS primarily comprises high-lift devices (flaps and slats), drag devices (spoilers), and the trim system, all electronically controlled and monitored via the Flight Control Computer (FCC).

## 2. System Components

The AMPEL360XLRGA Secondary Flight Control System is an electronically controlled system, integrated into the overall Fly-by-Wire architecture. Key components are detailed below:

### 2.1 High-Lift Devices - Flaps

*   **Component Designation:** Flap System - **GPAM-AMPEL-0201-28-FLAP-001-A**
*   **Type:**  Double-Slotted Fowler Flaps, full-span on each wing trailing edge. Double-slotted design provides high lift augmentation for takeoff and landing, while Fowler action increases wing area and chord.
*   **Function:**  Increase lift coefficient (Cl_max) and lift at low speeds, reducing takeoff and landing speeds and distances.  Enable steeper approach angles and improved low-speed maneuverability.
*   **Actuation:**  Electro-Mechanical Actuation System (EMAS) - **Liebherr-Aerospace Flap Actuation System** (or equivalent) - centralized, high-torque EMAS driving flap segments on each wing via torque tubes and gearboxes. Redundancy features within EMAS architecture (TBD - detail redundancy mechanisms within EMAS).
*   **Segments:** [Placeholder: Specify Number] Flap Segments per wing, independently actuated within each wing set, but synchronized for symmetrical deployment.
*   **Position Feedback:**  Rotary Position Sensors (resolvers or encoders) within the EMAS provide precise flap position feedback to the Flight Control Computer (FCC). Redundant position sensors within the EMAS and discrete flap position sensor signals for backup indication.  Flap position indication displayed on Flight Deck Display System (FDDS).
*   **Materials:**  Aluminum Alloy primary structure with Carbon Fiber Composite skin panels for optimized strength-to-weight ratio.  Leading edges with erosion-resistant coating.

*   **Component Designation:** Slat System - **GPAM-AMPEL-0201-28-SLAT-001-A**
*   **Type:**  Leading-Edge Slats, full-span on each wing leading edge.  Extendable slats to increase wing camber and improve airflow at high angles of attack.
*   **Function:**  Increase maximum lift coefficient (Cl_max), improve stall margin, and enhance low-speed handling characteristics. Allow for higher angles of attack before stall, improving safety margin during takeoff and landing.
*   **Actuation:**  Electro-Mechanical Actuation System (EMAS) - **Collins Aerospace Slat Actuation System** (or equivalent) - centralized EMAS architecture similar to flap system, driving slats on each wing via torque tubes and gearboxes. Redundancy features TBD (detail redundancy mechanisms within EMAS).
*   **Segments:** [Placeholder: Specify Number] Slat Segments per wing, synchronized for symmetrical deployment.
*   **Position Feedback:** Rotary Position Sensors within the EMAS and discrete slat position sensor signals provide slat position feedback to the FCC.  Slat position indication displayed on FDDS.

*   **Location:** Leading edge of each wing, extending along the wing span.

### 2.3 Drag Devices - Spoilers

*   **Component Designation:** Spoiler System - **GPAM-AMPEL-0201-28-SPOILER-001-A**
*   **Type:** Multi-function Spoilers, located on the upper surface of each wing:
    *   **Inboard Spoilers:** Used primarily as speed brakes in flight for descent and deceleration. Can also augment roll control at high speeds (limited deflection).
    *   **Outboard Spoilers:**  Primarily used as roll spoilers (differential deployment) for roll augmentation and control. Also function as ground spoilers for lift dump on landing (full deployment).

*   **Function:**
    *   **Flight Spoilers (Inboard):** Increase drag for descent rate control and speed reduction in flight.
    *   **Roll Spoilers (Outboard):** Augment roll control, especially at higher speeds where aileron effectiveness might be reduced.
    *   **Ground Spoilers (All Segments):**  Reduce lift and increase drag immediately upon touchdown, improving braking effectiveness and preventing aerodynamic lift-off after landing.
*   **Actuation:** Electro-Mechanical Actuators (EMAs) - **[Placeholder: Specify EMA Model - e.g., Parker Hannifin EMA Series]**.  Individual EMAs for each spoiler segment provide independent and precise control. Redundancy architecture TBD (specify redundancy for spoiler actuation – e.g., dual EMAs for critical segments, or redundancy within FCC control channels).
*   **Segments:** [Placeholder: Specify Number] Spoiler Segments per wing (combination of inboard and outboard segments). Independent control of each segment for multifunctionality.
*   **Position Feedback:** Integrated Position Sensors (potentiometers or LVDTs) on each spoiler actuator provide spoiler position feedback to the FCC. Spoiler position indication on FDDS (spoiler deployment status).
*   **Materials:** Aluminum Alloy structure with composite skin panels.  Aerodynamically contoured for efficient drag generation and minimized aerodynamic noise.
*   **Location:** Upper surface of each wing, spanning chordwise and spanwise.

### 2.4 Trim System

*   **Component Designation:** Trim System - **GPAM-AMPEL-0201-28-TRIM-001-A**
*   **Type:**  Full Electric Trim System, acting on elevators, ailerons, and rudder.  No separate trim tabs on control surfaces.  Trim adjustments are achieved by electrically repositioning the entire control surface or by biasing the actuator neutral position.
*   **Function:**  Provide adjustable control forces to maintain desired aircraft attitude and reduce pilot workload, especially during extended flight phases. Compensate for aerodynamic imbalances, center of gravity shifts, and changes in flight conditions.
*   **Trim Axes:**
    *   **Elevator Trim (Pitch Trim):** Adjusts longitudinal trim to maintain pitch attitude and airspeed. Controlled by electric trim switches on control yokes and potentially via Autopilot system.
    *   **Aileron Trim (Roll Trim):** Adjusts lateral trim to maintain wings-level flight and counter roll imbalances. Controlled by electric trim switches on control yokes and potentially via Autopilot system.
    *   **Rudder Trim (Yaw Trim):** Adjusts directional trim to maintain coordinated flight and counter yaw imbalances (e.g., due to engine failure in multi-engine configurations - although AMPEL360XLRGA is currently single-engine Q-01 - future variants may be multi-engine). Controlled by electric trim switches on center pedestal and potentially via Autopilot system.
*   **Actuation:**
    *   **Electric Trim Actuators:**  Dedicated Electro-Mechanical Actuators (EMAs) - [Placeholder: Specify EMA Models - e.g.,  Duff-Norton rotary EMAs for trim adjustment] for each trim axis (elevator, aileron, rudder).  These EMAs subtly reposition the corresponding primary control surface or adjust the neutral position of the main control actuators to achieve trim.
    *   **Trim Control Circuits:**  Electronic control circuits within the FCC manage trim actuator commands based on pilot inputs, autopilot commands, and flight condition data.
*   **Cockpit Controls:**
    *   **Electric Trim Switches:**  Multi-direction electric trim switches on control yokes (for elevator and aileron trim) and center pedestal (for rudder trim).  Allow for precise manual trim adjustment by the pilot.
    *   **Trim Position Indicators:**  Digital trim position indicators on the Flight Deck Display System (FDDS) display the current trim settings for elevator, aileron, and rudder axes.  Graphical and numerical indication.

    *   **Trim Rate Limiting:**  Electronically limited trim actuator rates to prevent excessively rapid trim changes.
    *   **Trim Disconnect Switches:**  Quick disconnect switches on control yokes and center pedestal to immediately interrupt power to trim actuators in case of malfunction or runaway.
    *   **FCC Monitoring and Fault Detection:**  FCC monitors trim system operation, actuator positions, and trim commands for anomalies. Detects and annunciates trim system faults via EICAS.
*   **Materials:** EMAs and trim system components constructed from high-reliability aerospace-grade materials – Aluminum Alloys, high-strength steels, and robust electrical connectors.

### 2.5 Actuators (SFCS)

*   **Actuator Types:**  Electro-Mechanical Actuators (EMAs) and Electro-Mechanical Actuation Systems (EMAS) are the primary actuator types for the Secondary Flight Control System components in the AMPEL360XLRGA.
    *   **EMAs (Electro-Mechanical Actuators):**  Used for individual spoiler segment actuation and trim system actuation.  Provide precise, direct linear or rotary motion control. Examples: Parker Hannifin EMA Series, Curtiss-Wright EMA-3000 Series, Safran EMA-2500 Series, Duff-Norton Rotary EMAs.
    *   **EMAS (Electro-Mechanical Actuation Systems):**  Used for Flap and Slat systems.  Centralized systems employing a motor, gearbox, and torque tube or rotary actuator to drive multiple flap or slat segments in a synchronized manner. Examples: Liebherr-Aerospace Flap Actuation System, Collins Aerospace Slat Actuation System.
*   **Actuator Characteristics:**
    *   **Electric Actuation:**  All SFCS actuators are electrically powered and controlled, eliminating the need for hydraulic systems in the SFCS.
    *   **Position Feedback:** Integrated position sensors (LVDTs, resolvers, encoders, potentiometers) provide accurate position feedback to the FCC for closed-loop control.
    *   **Redundancy:** Redundancy is incorporated in critical SFCS actuators and actuation systems (TBD - detail redundancy architecture for each actuator type - e.g., dual EMAs for spoilers, redundancy within EMAS for flaps/slats).
    *   **Reliability and Maintainability:**  EMAs and EMAS are selected for high reliability, long service life, and ease of maintenance in aerospace environments.
*   **Control and Command:** Actuators are commanded by the Flight Control Computer (FCC) via digital commands transmitted over ARINC 429 data buses or potentially dedicated CAN bus interfaces (TBD – confirm SFCS actuator interface details).

### 2.6 Control Linkages and Signal Transmission (SFCS)

*   **Electronic Control:** The AMPEL360XLRGA SFCS is electronically controlled as part of the overall Fly-by-Wire system. Pilot inputs from cockpit controls (flap/slat levers, spoiler switches, trim switches) and FCC commands are transmitted electronically to the SFCS actuators.
*   **Signal Transmission (SFCS):**
    *   **Digital Data Buses (ARINC 429, CAN bus - TBD):** ARINC 429 data buses are likely used for transmitting commands to SFCS actuators and receiving position feedback, similar to the PFCS. CAN bus may also be utilized for certain SFCS components or for internal communication within actuation systems (TBD – confirm communication protocols for SFCS).
    *   **Discrete Wiring:** Discrete wiring for power supply to actuators, position sensor signals, and status indications.
    *   **Shielding and EMI Protection:** SFCS wiring is shielded and routed to minimize EMI/EMC interference, ensuring signal integrity in the aircraft environment.

*   **Mechanical Linkages (Within Actuation Systems):** While pilot input and control commands are electronic, there will be *internal mechanical linkages* within the EMAS for flap and slat systems (torque tubes, gears, linkages to synchronize segment movement) and within the EMAs themselves (gears, lead screws to translate rotary to linear motion, etc.). These mechanical components are designed for high reliability and are subject to inspection and maintenance.

### 2.7 Sensors and Feedback (SFCS)

*   **Position Sensors:**
    *   **Flap Position Sensors:** Rotary position sensors (resolvers, encoders) and discrete position sensors within the Flap EMAS provide flap position feedback.
    *   **Slat Position Sensors:** Rotary position sensors and discrete position sensors within the Slat EMAS provide slat position feedback.
    *   **Spoiler Position Sensors:** Position sensors (potentiometers, LVDTs) integrated into each Spoiler EMA provide spoiler segment position feedback.
    *   **Trim Position Sensors:**  Position sensors (rotary encoders or potentiometers) within the trim EMAs provide trim position feedback for elevator, aileron, and rudder trim axes.  Trim position indicators in cockpit receive data from these sensors.
*   **Status Sensors:**  Status sensors within the EMAS and EMAs provide feedback on actuator health, motor current, temperature, and other operational parameters for BITE and system monitoring.  [Placeholder: Specify types of status sensors within SFCS actuators – e.g., current sensors, temperature sensors, limit switches].

## 3. System Operation

The AMPEL360XLRGA SFCS operation is integrated with the PFCS and overall flight control system.  Key aspects of SFCS operation:

*   **Flap and Slat Deployment:**
    *   **Cockpit Control:**  Pilot controls flap and slat deployment via a Flap/Slat Lever or Selector in the cockpit.  Typical flap/slat positions:  UP (retracted), TAKEOFF (intermediate extension), LANDING (full extension). Slat deployment is typically linked to flap deployment (automatic slat extension with flap extension – TBD if pilot has independent slat control).
    *   **FCC Control:** The Flight Control Computer (FCC) receives pilot flap/slat lever inputs and commands the Flap and Slat EMAS to deploy the flaps and slats to the selected positions. FCC monitors position feedback and ensures synchronized and symmetrical deployment.
    *   **Flight Phase Dependent Deployment (Automatic Features - TBD):** [Placeholder: Specify if there are automatic flap/slat deployment features based on flight phase, airspeed, angle of attack, or FMS inputs - e.g., automatic flap retraction with airspeed increase after takeoff, automatic slat extension during approach].  If automatic features are implemented, detail the triggering logic and pilot override capability.
*   **Spoiler Operation:**
    *   **Flight Spoilers (Speed Brakes):**  Pilot can deploy flight spoilers (inboard spoilers) using a dedicated Spoiler Lever or switch in the cockpit. Flight spoiler deployment is typically proportional to lever position.  Used for descent rate control and airspeed management in flight.  FCC commands inboard spoiler EMAs.
    *   **Roll Spoilers:** Outboard spoilers are automatically deployed differentially by the FCC to augment roll control, especially at higher speeds.  Roll spoiler deflection is commanded by the FCC based on pilot roll inputs and flight control laws.  Pilot does not directly control roll spoilers independently.
    *   **Ground Spoilers:** All spoiler segments (inboard and outboard) are automatically deployed fully upon touchdown. Touchdown detection is sensed by landing gear strut switches and signals are sent to the FCC, which commands full spoiler deployment. Ground spoilers retract upon takeoff initiation (throttle advance, airspeed increase - TBD for specific ground spoiler retraction logic).
*   **Trim System Operation:**
    *   **Pilot Trim Inputs:** Pilot adjusts elevator, aileron, and rudder trim using electric trim switches on control yokes and center pedestal.  Trim commands are sent to the FCC.
    *   **FCC Trim Control:**  FCC receives pilot trim commands and commands the respective trim EMAs to adjust the trim settings for elevator, aileron, and rudder axes. FCC monitors trim position feedback.
    *   **Autopilot Trim Control:** Autopilot system also utilizes the trim system to maintain desired aircraft attitude and flight path. Autopilot commands trim adjustments via the FCC, overriding or augmenting pilot manual trim inputs when autopilot is engaged.
    *   **Trim Position Indication:** Current trim positions for elevator, aileron, and rudder are continuously displayed on the Flight Deck Display System (FDDS) for pilot awareness.
