### 2.5 Control Linkages and Signal Transmission

*   **Fly-by-Wire System:**  The AMPEL360XLRGA PFCS is a fully FBW system. There are **no direct mechanical linkages** between the cockpit controls and the control surfaces. Pilot inputs are sensed electronically, processed by the FCC, and then commands are sent electronically to the actuators.
*   **Signal Transmission:**
    *   **Digital Data Buses:**  ARINC 429 digital data buses are the primary means of transmitting control input signals from the cockpit controls to the FCC, and control commands from the FCC to the actuators and cockpit displays.
    *   **Redundancy:** Redundant ARINC 429 buses are used for critical control signals to enhance fault tolerance. [Placeholder: Specify redundancy architecture for ARINC 429 buses - e.g., dual redundant buses, cross-channel data monitoring].
    *   **Discrete Wiring:**  Discrete wiring is used for essential functions such as power supply, emergency disconnects, and some status indications.
    *   **Shielding and EMI Protection:**  All critical control wiring is shielded and routed to minimize EMI/EMC susceptibility and ensure signal integrity in the harsh aircraft environment. Wiring and shielding compliant with [Placeholder: Specify Standard - e.g., MIL-W-22759, DO-160G Section 22].
*   **Control Cables and Rods (Mechanical Backup - None):**  As a fully FBW system, the AMPEL360XLRGA PFCS **does not incorporate mechanical control cables or rods as a backup**. Redundancy and fault tolerance are achieved through the dual-redundant FCC architecture, redundant actuators, and robust software design.  Loss of all electrical power to the PFCS is a catastrophic failure scenario that is mitigated by the aircraft's overall power system architecture and emergency power provisions (detailed in GPAM-AMPEL-0201-25-001-A, Electrical Power System Description).

### 2.6 Sensors and Feedback

## 3. System Operation

The AMPEL360XLRGA PFCS operates as a closed-loop, fully digital fly-by-wire system.  The basic operational principles are:

*   **Pilot Input Acquisition:** Pilot control inputs from the control yoke and rudder pedals are sensed by position and force sensors. These analog signals are converted to digital data and transmitted to the FCC via ARINC 429 buses.
*   **Sensor Data Acquisition:** The FCC continuously receives data from various aircraft sensors: ADS, IRS, AoA sensors, control surface position sensors, and potentially load sensors. Sensor data is validated and processed within the FCC.
*   **Control Law Computation:** The FCC executes complex, pre-programmed control laws (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-27-CLD-001-A, Control Law Design Document) to determine the required control surface deflections. These control laws are designed to provide:
    *   **Stability and Controllability:**  Ensure inherent aircraft stability and predictable, responsive control characteristics across the flight envelope.
    *   **Flight Envelope Protection:**  Implement robust flight envelope protection algorithms (Section 3.2.3 of GPAM-AMPEL-0201-22-003-A) to prevent stalls, overspeed, excessive bank angles, and pitch attitudes, enhancing safety.
    *   **Pilot Command Following:**  Accurately translate pilot control inputs into desired aircraft maneuvers while providing a natural and intuitive feel.
    *   **Gust Load Alleviation:**  Control laws may incorporate algorithms to actively dampen the effects of gusts and turbulence on the airframe, improving ride comfort and reducing structural loads (advanced feature - TBD).
    *   **OIP Integration:**  The PFCS control laws are designed to seamlessly integrate with the Optimized Influence Protocol (OIP) (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-22-004-A), allowing for subtle control augmentations in Co-Pilot Mode, while always prioritizing pilot command authority and flight envelope protection.
*   **Actuator Command Generation:** Based on the control law computations, the FCC generates digital command signals for the Electro-Hydrostatic Actuators (EHAs) and Electro-Mechanical Actuators (EMAs) controlling the ailerons, elevators, rudder, spoilers, flaps, and slats. These commands are transmitted via ARINC 429 buses.
*   **Actuator Control and Feedback:** The actuators respond to the FCC commands by precisely positioning the control surfaces. Integrated position sensors within the actuators provide closed-loop feedback to the FCC, ensuring accurate control surface deflection.
*   **System Monitoring and BITE:** The FCC continuously monitors the health and performance of the PFCS through Built-In Test Equipment (BITE) (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-27-SW-BITE-001-A). BITE monitors sensor validity, actuator performance, communication link integrity, and FCC internal functions. Faults are detected, logged, and annunciated to the pilot via the EICAS and Autopilot Control Panel (fault annunciation logic TBD - integration with EICAS - GPAM-AMPEL-TBD).
*   **Redundancy Management:** The FCC’s Redundancy Management Software (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-27-SW-RM-001-A) continuously monitors the health of the primary and secondary FCC channels. In case of a primary FCC failure, the secondary FCC automatically and seamlessly takes over control of the PFCS, ensuring continued operation with minimal transient effects.  Pilot is alerted to FCC failover via EICAS message (TBD - EICAS message format).

The AMPEL360XLRGA PFCS incorporates multiple layers of safety features to ensure highly reliable and safe flight control:

*   **Dual-Redundant Flight Control Computers (FCCs):**  Hot-standby dual redundancy of the FCC is the cornerstone of PFCS safety. Automatic failover to the secondary FCC in case of primary FCC failure ensures continued flight control capability. Redundancy management logic within the FCC (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-27-SW-RM-001-A) manages failover seamlessly.
*   **Redundant Actuators:**  Dual Electro-Hydrostatic Actuators (EHAs) for ailerons and dual Electro-Mechanical Actuators (EMAs) for elevators and rudder (TBD - confirm redundancy architecture for actuators) provide actuator redundancy.  In case of a single actuator failure, the remaining actuator(s) can maintain control authority.
*   **Redundant Position Sensors:**  Redundant LVDT position sensors within actuators and rotary position sensors in control linkages provide multiple independent sources of control surface position feedback to the FCC, mitigating the risk of sensor failures.
*   **Flight Envelope Protection (FEP):**  Robust Flight Envelope Protection algorithms (Section 3.2.3 of GPAM-AMPEL-0201-22-003-A) implemented within the FCC software prevent the aircraft from exceeding safe operating limits, even in case of pilot incapacitation or system malfunctions. FEP is a critical safety layer in the FBW system.
*   **Built-In Test Equipment (BITE):**  Comprehensive BITE continuously monitors PFCS component health, sensor validity, actuator performance, and communication link integrity. BITE enables rapid fault detection and isolation, facilitating efficient maintenance and ensuring system integrity.
*   **Jam-Proof Control Surface Design:**  Control surface linkages and actuator designs are engineered to minimize the possibility of mechanical jamming. Actuator designs incorporate features to prevent jamming and allow for breakaway in case of extreme overload. [Placeholder: Specify details of jam-proofing features - e.g., shear pins, breakaway linkages in actuator design].
*   **Electrical System Redundancy:** The PFCS relies on a redundant Electrical Power System (GPAM-AMPEL-0201-25-001-A) to ensure continuous power supply to the FCCs and actuators.  Multiple power sources and distribution buses are designed to mitigate the risk of power loss.
*   **Lightning Strike Protection:** PFCS components and wiring are designed and shielded to withstand and mitigate the effects of lightning strikes, protecting critical control functions. Lightning protection measures comply with [Placeholder: Specify Standard - e.g., DO-160G Section 22, SAE ARP5416].
