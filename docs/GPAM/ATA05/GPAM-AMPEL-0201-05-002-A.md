| Flight Hours  | 100 FH         | Minor inspection and servicing |
| Flight Hours  | 500 FH         | Intermediate inspection and servicing |
| Flight Hours  | 1000 FH        | Major inspection and servicing |
| Calendar Time | 6 months       | Minor inspection and servicing |
| Calendar Time | 12 months      | Intermediate inspection and servicing |
| Calendar Time | 24 months      | Major inspection and servicing |
| Cycles        | 200 cycles     | Minor inspection and servicing |
| Cycles        | 1000 cycles    | Intermediate inspection and servicing |
| Cycles        | 2000 cycles    | Major inspection and servicing |
