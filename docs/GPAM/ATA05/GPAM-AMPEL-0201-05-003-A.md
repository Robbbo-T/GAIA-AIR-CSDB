This document outlines the time limits for various maintenance tasks, inspections, and overhauls in accordance with regulatory requirements and manufacturer recommendations.

**Note:** This document includes specific maintenance tasks and intervals for the Quantum Propulsion System (QPS) integrated into the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft.

## Airworthiness Limitations

The airworthiness limitations for the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft are based on flight hours, calendar time, and cycles. The following table provides an overview of the airworthiness limitations:

| Interval Type | Interval Value | Description |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Flight Hours  | 100 FH         | Minor inspection and servicing |
| Flight Hours  | 500 FH         | Intermediate inspection and servicing |
| Flight Hours  | 1000 FH        | Major inspection and servicing |
| Calendar Time | 6 months       | Minor inspection and servicing |
| Calendar Time | 12 months      | Intermediate inspection and servicing |
| Calendar Time | 24 months      | Major inspection and servicing |
| Cycles        | 200 cycles     | Minor inspection and servicing |
| Cycles        | 1000 cycles    | Intermediate inspection and servicing |
| Cycles        | 2000 cycles    | Major inspection and servicing |

## Maintenance Tasks
