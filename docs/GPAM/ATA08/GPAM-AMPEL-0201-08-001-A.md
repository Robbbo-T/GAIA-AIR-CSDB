## Leveling Points

The AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft has designated leveling points that must be used to ensure accurate leveling. The following table provides an overview of the leveling points:

| Leveling Point | Location                          | Description                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| LP1            | Forward fuselage, near nose gear  | Primary leveling point                |
| LP2            | Aft fuselage, near tail gear      | Secondary leveling point              |
| LP3            | Wing root, left side              | Auxiliary leveling point              |
| LP4            | Wing root, right side             | Auxiliary leveling point              |

## Leveling Procedure

The following steps outline the procedure for leveling the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft:

1. **Prepare the Aircraft:**
   - Ensure the aircraft is on a level surface and all landing gear is properly extended.
   - Remove any external loads or equipment that may affect the aircraft's balance.

2. **Position the Jacks:**
   - Place the aircraft jacks under the designated jack points as specified in the AMM.
   - Raise the aircraft using the jacks until the landing gear is off the ground.

3. **Level the Aircraft:**
   - Place the spirit level or electronic level on the primary leveling point (LP1).
   - Adjust the jacks to achieve a level reading on the spirit level.
   - Verify the level at the secondary leveling point (LP2) and make any necessary adjustments.
   - Check the level at the auxiliary leveling points (LP3 and LP4) to ensure the aircraft is level laterally.

4. **Secure the Aircraft:**
   - Once the aircraft is level, secure the jacks to prevent any movement.
   - Mark the leveling points with chalk or a marking tool for reference.

5. **Verify Leveling:**
   - Recheck the level at all leveling points to ensure the aircraft remains level.
   - Document the leveling procedure in the aircraft's maintenance logbook.

## Documentation and Records

All leveling activities must be documented in the aircraft's maintenance logbook. The following information should be recorded for each leveling procedure:

- Date and time of leveling
- Description of leveling procedure performed
- Name and signature of technician
- Reference points and leveling points used
- Any discrepancies or issues found and corrective actions taken

## Compliance and Certification

The Leveling Procedures document complies with the following regulatory requirements and standards:

- Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations
- European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations
- International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards
- Manufacturer's maintenance manual and service bulletins

## Conclusion

The Leveling Procedures document for the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft provides essential instructions for accurately leveling the aircraft during maintenance and inspection activities. By following the steps outlined in this document, technicians can ensure accurate measurements, alignments, and calibrations, maintaining the aircraft's airworthiness and operational efficiency.
