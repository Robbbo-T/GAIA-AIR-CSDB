- Spirit level or electronic level
- Plumb bob
- Measuring tape
- Chalk or marking tool
- Aircraft maintenance manual (AMM)

## Weighing Points

The AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft has designated weighing points that must be used to ensure accurate weighing. The following table provides an overview of the weighing points:

| Weighing Point | Location                          | Description                           |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| WP1            | Forward fuselage, near nose gear  | Primary weighing point                |
| WP2            | Aft fuselage, near tail gear      | Secondary weighing point              |
| WP3            | Wing root, left side              | Auxiliary weighing point              |
| WP4            | Wing root, right side             | Auxiliary weighing point              |

## Weighing Procedure

The following steps outline the procedure for weighing the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft:

1. **Prepare the Aircraft:**
   - Ensure the aircraft is on a level surface and all landing gear is properly extended.
   - Remove any external loads or equipment that may affect the aircraft's weight.

2. **Position the Scales:**
   - Place the aircraft scales under the designated weighing points as specified in the AMM.
   - Ensure the scales are properly calibrated and zeroed.

3. **Weigh the Aircraft:**
   - Lower the aircraft onto the scales using the jacks until the landing gear is fully supported by the scales.
   - Record the weight readings from each scale.

4. **Calculate the Total Weight:**
   - Sum the weight readings from all scales to obtain the total weight of the aircraft.
   - Verify the total weight against the aircraft's weight and balance records.

5. **Document the Weighing:**
   - Record the weighing procedure in the aircraft's maintenance logbook.
   - Include the date, time, and weight readings for each weighing point.
   - Note any discrepancies or issues found and corrective actions taken.

## Documentation and Records

All weighing activities must be documented in the aircraft's maintenance logbook. The following information should be recorded for each weighing procedure:

- Date and time of weighing
- Description of weighing procedure performed
- Name and signature of technician
- Weight readings for each weighing point
- Total weight of the aircraft
- Any discrepancies or issues found and corrective actions taken

## Compliance and Certification

The Aircraft Weighing Procedures document complies with the following regulatory requirements and standards:

- Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations
- European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations
- International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards
- Manufacturer's maintenance manual and service bulletins

## Conclusion

The Aircraft Weighing Procedures document for the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft provides essential instructions for accurately weighing the aircraft during maintenance and inspection activities. By following the steps outlined in this document, technicians can ensure accurate weight and balance calculations, maintaining the aircraft's airworthiness and operational efficiency.
