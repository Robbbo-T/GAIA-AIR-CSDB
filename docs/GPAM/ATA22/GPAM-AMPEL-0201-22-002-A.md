**Document Code:** GPAM-AMPEL-0201-22-002-A

## Introduction

The Autopilot Modes and Functions document for the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft provides the necessary guidelines and specifications for the design, installation, and maintenance of the autopilot system. This document ensures the proper functioning and operational efficiency of the autopilot system, maintaining the safety and comfort of the aircraft's occupants.

## System Overview

The autopilot system in the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft is designed to provide automatic control of the aircraft's flight path, reducing the workload on the pilot and enhancing flight safety. The system consists of the following main components:

- Autopilot Computer
- Control Panel
- Sensors and Feedback Mechanisms
- Actuators
- Communication Interfaces

## Autopilot Modes

The autopilot system supports various modes of operation, each designed to control specific aspects of the aircraft's flight path. The following sections provide an overview of the key autopilot modes.

### Heading Hold Mode

The Heading Hold Mode maintains the aircraft's current heading by controlling the ailerons and rudder. The mode is engaged by selecting the desired heading on the control panel and activating the autopilot.

### Altitude Hold Mode

The Altitude Hold Mode maintains the aircraft's current altitude by controlling the elevators. The mode is engaged by selecting the desired altitude on the control panel and activating the autopilot.

### Vertical Speed Mode

The Vertical Speed Mode controls the aircraft's rate of climb or descent by adjusting the elevators. The mode is engaged by selecting the desired vertical speed on the control panel and activating the autopilot.

### Navigation Mode

The Navigation Mode follows a predefined flight path based on input from the aircraft's navigation systems. The mode is engaged by selecting the desired navigation source on the control panel and activating the autopilot.

### Approach Mode

The Approach Mode assists the pilot in performing a precision approach and landing by controlling the aircraft's descent rate and alignment with the runway. The mode is engaged by selecting the desired approach procedure on the control panel and activating the autopilot.

## Autopilot Functions

The autopilot system provides various functions to enhance flight safety and efficiency. The following sections provide an overview of the key autopilot functions.

### Autothrottle

The Autothrottle function automatically adjusts the aircraft's throttle settings to maintain the desired airspeed. The function is engaged by selecting the desired airspeed on the control panel and activating the autothrottle.

### Flight Director

The Flight Director function provides visual guidance to the pilot for manually flying the aircraft along a desired flight path. The function is engaged by selecting the desired flight path on the control panel and activating the flight director.

### Yaw Damper

The Yaw Damper function automatically adjusts the aircraft's rudder to counteract yawing motions and maintain stability. The function is engaged by activating the yaw damper on the control panel.

### Trim Control

The Trim Control function automatically adjusts the aircraft's trim settings to maintain the desired flight attitude. The function is engaged by activating the trim control on the control panel.
