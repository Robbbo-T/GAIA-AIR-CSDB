- Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Memory Modules
- Input/Output (I/O) Interfaces
- Redundant Processing Channels
- Built-In Test Equipment (BITE)

## Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS)

The AHRS provides the FDC with real-time data on the aircraft's attitude, heading, and rate of turn. The AHRS consists of the following components:

- Attitude Sensors
- Heading Sensors
- Rate Gyros
- Accelerometers

## Air Data Computer (ADC)

The ADC provides the FDC with real-time data on the aircraft's airspeed, altitude, and vertical speed. The ADC consists of the following components:

- Airspeed Sensors
- Altitude Sensors
- Vertical Speed Sensors
- Temperature Sensors

## Display Units

The display units provide the pilot with visual guidance cues generated by the FDC. The display units consist of the following components:

- Primary Flight Display (PFD)
- Navigation Display (ND)
- Multi-Function Display (MFD)

## Control Panel

The control panel allows the pilot to interact with the FDS, selecting modes and adjusting settings. The control panel consists of the following components:

- Mode Selector
- Knobs and Buttons
- Indicator Lights

## Communication Interfaces

The FDS communicates with other avionics systems and the pilot through various communication interfaces, including:

- ARINC 429
- MIL-STD-1553
- Ethernet
- RS-232/RS-485

## System Architecture

The FDS system architecture is designed to provide high reliability and fault tolerance. The architecture includes:

- Redundant Processing Channels
- Fault Detection and Isolation
- Built-In Test Equipment (BITE)
- Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
