|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| 2024-T3       | High-strength aluminum alloy with good fatigue resistance |
| 7075-T6       | High-strength aluminum alloy with excellent corrosion resistance |

### Composite Materials

In addition to aluminum alloys, composite materials are used in certain areas of the fuel tanks to provide additional strength and weight savings. The following table provides an overview of the composite materials used in the fuel tanks:

| Composite Type| Description                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|
| Carbon Fiber  | High-strength, lightweight material with excellent fatigue resistance |
| Kevlar        | High-strength, lightweight material with excellent impact resistance |

## Fuel Tank Inspection and Maintenance

Regular inspection and maintenance of the fuel tanks are essential to ensure their continued safety and reliability. The following sections outline the inspection and maintenance procedures for the fuel tanks.

### Visual Inspection

Visual inspection of the fuel tanks should be performed at regular intervals to identify any signs of damage, corrosion, or leaks. The following steps outline the visual inspection procedure:

1. Remove any access panels or covers to expose the fuel tanks.
2. Inspect the exterior surfaces of the fuel tanks for signs of damage, corrosion, or leaks.
3. Inspect the interior surfaces of the fuel tanks for signs of contamination or corrosion.
4. Document any discrepancies or issues found and take corrective actions as necessary.

### Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)

Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods, such as ultrasonic testing or dye penetrant inspection, should be used to detect any internal defects or cracks in the fuel tanks. The following steps outline the NDT procedure:

1. Prepare the fuel tanks for NDT by cleaning the surfaces and removing any contaminants.
2. Perform the NDT using the appropriate method and equipment.
3. Document any defects or issues found and take corrective actions as necessary.

### Maintenance and Repair

Maintenance and repair of the fuel tanks should be performed in accordance with the manufacturer's maintenance manual and service bulletins. The following steps outline the maintenance and repair procedure:

1. Identify the area of the fuel tank that requires maintenance or repair.
2. Perform the necessary maintenance or repair tasks, such as patching, sealing, or replacing damaged components.
3. Inspect the repaired area to ensure it meets the required standards and specifications.
4. Document the maintenance or repair activities in the aircraft's maintenance logbook.

## Documentation and Records

All maintenance activities related to the fuel tanks must be documented in the aircraft's maintenance logbook. The following information should be recorded for each maintenance task:

- Date and time of maintenance
- Description of task performed
