| RP2             | Right wing, near wing root        | Primary refueling point for right wing |
| RP3             | Center fuselage, near main landing gear | Auxiliary refueling point for center tank |

## Refueling Procedure

The following steps outline the procedure for refueling the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft:

1. **Prepare the Aircraft:**
   - Ensure the aircraft is parked on a level surface and all engines are shut down.
   - Verify that all personnel are clear of the refueling area.
   - Connect the grounding cables to the aircraft and the refueling truck or fuel source.

2. **Inspect the Equipment:**
   - Inspect the fuel hoses and nozzles for damage or wear.
   - Verify that the fuel quantity indicators are functioning properly.
   - Ensure that all PPE is worn by personnel involved in the refueling process.

3. **Connect the Fuel Hoses:**
   - Connect the fuel hoses to the designated refueling points (RP1, RP2, and RP3).
   - Verify that the connections are secure and free of leaks.

4. **Refuel the Aircraft:**
   - Begin refueling the aircraft by opening the fuel valves on the refueling truck or fuel source.
   - Monitor the fuel quantity indicators to ensure the correct amount of fuel is being delivered.
   - Adjust the fuel flow rate as necessary to prevent overfilling.

5. **Complete the Refueling:**
   - Once the desired fuel quantity has been reached, close the fuel valves on the refueling truck or fuel source.
   - Disconnect the fuel hoses from the refueling points and inspect for any fuel spills or leaks.
   - Remove the grounding cables from the aircraft and the refueling truck or fuel source.

6. **Document the Refueling:**
   - Record the date, time, and quantity of fuel added in the aircraft's maintenance logbook.
   - Include the name and signature of the technician performing the refueling.

## Safety Precautions

The following safety precautions must be observed during the refueling process to ensure the safety of personnel and the aircraft:

- Ensure that all personnel involved in the refueling process are properly trained and certified.
- Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times.
- Do not smoke or use open flames in the refueling area.
- Ensure that the aircraft and refueling equipment are properly grounded to prevent static discharge.
- Monitor the refueling process closely to prevent overfilling and fuel spills.
- In the event of a fuel spill, immediately stop the refueling process and follow the spill response procedures outlined in the aircraft's maintenance manual.

## Documentation and Records

All refueling activities must be documented in the aircraft's maintenance logbook. The following information should be recorded for each refueling procedure:

- Date and time of refueling
- Description of refueling procedure performed
- Name and signature of technician
- Quantity of fuel added
- Any discrepancies or issues found and corrective actions taken

## Compliance and Certification

The Refueling Procedures document complies with the following regulatory requirements and standards:

- Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations
- European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations
- International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards
- Manufacturer's maintenance manual and service bulletins

## Conclusion

The Refueling Procedures document for the AMPEL360XWLRGA aircraft provides essential instructions for safely refueling the aircraft.
