| Tank Location | Capacity (liters) | Description                           |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Left Wing     | 5000              | Main fuel tank in the left wing       |
| Right Wing    | 5000              | Main fuel tank in the right wing      |
| Center        | 3000              | Auxiliary fuel tank in the fuselage   |
| Aft           | 2000              | Auxiliary fuel tank in the tail section |

### Fuel Pumps

The fuel system includes multiple fuel pumps to ensure a continuous and reliable supply of fuel to the engines. The pumps are designed to operate under various conditions, including normal flight, takeoff, and landing. The following table provides an overview of the fuel pumps:

| Pump Type     | Location          | Description                           |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Main Pump     | Left Wing         | Primary pump for the left wing tank   |
| Main Pump     | Right Wing        | Primary pump for the right wing tank  |
| Auxiliary Pump| Center            | Pump for the center auxiliary tank    |
| Auxiliary Pump| Aft               | Pump for the aft auxiliary tank       |
| Boost Pump    | Engine Nacelle    | Boost pump for engine fuel supply     |

### Fuel Valves

The fuel system includes various valves to control the flow of fuel between tanks and to the engines. The valves are designed to ensure proper fuel management and prevent fuel leakage. The following table provides an overview of the fuel valves:

| Valve Type    | Location          | Description                           |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Crossfeed Valve | Wing Root       | Allows fuel transfer between wing tanks |
| Shutoff Valve | Engine Nacelle    | Isolates fuel supply to the engine    |
| Vent Valve    | Fuel Tanks        | Maintains proper tank pressure        |
| Drain Valve   | Fuel Tanks        | Allows for fuel drainage during maintenance |

### Fuel Filters

The fuel system includes multiple filters to remove contaminants and ensure clean fuel delivery to the engines. The filters are designed to operate under various conditions and are regularly inspected and replaced as part of the maintenance program. The following table provides an overview of the fuel filters:

| Filter Type   | Location          | Description                           |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Primary Filter| Engine Nacelle    | Main filter for engine fuel supply    |
| Secondary Filter | Wing Root      | Additional filter for wing tanks      |
| Auxiliary Filter | Center         | Filter for the center auxiliary tank  |
| Aft Filter    | Aft               | Filter for the aft auxiliary tank     |

## Fuel System Operation

The fuel system is designed to operate automatically, with manual override capabilities for specific situations. The following sections outline the normal operation and emergency procedures for the fuel system.

### Normal Operation

During normal operation, the fuel system automatically manages fuel flow between tanks and to the engines. The main pumps in the wing tanks supply fuel to the engines, while the auxiliary pumps transfer fuel from the center and aft tanks to the wing tanks as needed. The crossfeed valve allows for fuel transfer between wing tanks to maintain balance and ensure continuous fuel supply.

### Emergency Procedures

In the event of a fuel system malfunction, the following emergency procedures should be followed:

1. Identify the affected component and isolate it using the appropriate shutoff valve.
2. Activate the boost pump to ensure continuous fuel supply to the engine.
3. Monitor fuel pressure and flow indicators to ensure proper fuel delivery.
4. If necessary, transfer fuel between tanks using the crossfeed valve to maintain balance and prevent fuel starvation.

## Documentation and Records

All maintenance activities related to the fuel system must be documented in the aircraft's maintenance logbook. The following information should be recorded for each maintenance task:

- Date and time of maintenance
- Description of task performed
- Name and signature of technician
- Part numbers and serial numbers of replaced components
- Any discrepancies or issues found and corrective actions taken

## Compliance and Certification

The Fuel System Design document complies with the following regulatory requirements and standards:

- Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations
- European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations
- International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards
- Manufacturer's maintenance manual and service bulletins
