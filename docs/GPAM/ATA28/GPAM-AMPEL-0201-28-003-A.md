## Fuel Distribution System

The fuel distribution system is designed to manage the flow of fuel between tanks and to the engines efficiently and safely. The system includes various valves, filters, and associated plumbing. The following sections provide an overview of the key components and their functions.

### Fuel Valves

The fuel system includes various valves to control the flow of fuel between tanks and to the engines. The valves are designed to ensure proper fuel management and prevent fuel leakage. The following table provides an overview of the fuel valves:

| Valve Type    | Location          | Description                           |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Crossfeed Valve | Wing Root       | Allows fuel transfer between wing tanks |
| Shutoff Valve | Engine Nacelle    | Isolates fuel supply to the engine    |
| Vent Valve    | Fuel Tanks        | Maintains proper tank pressure        |
| Drain Valve   | Fuel Tanks        | Allows for fuel drainage during maintenance |

### Fuel Filters

The fuel system includes multiple filters to remove contaminants and ensure clean fuel delivery to the engines. The filters are designed to operate under various conditions and are regularly inspected and replaced as part of the maintenance program. The following table provides an overview of the fuel filters:

| Filter Type   | Location          | Description                           |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Primary Filter| Engine Nacelle    | Main filter for engine fuel supply    |
| Secondary Filter | Wing Root      | Additional filter for wing tanks      |
| Auxiliary Filter | Center         | Filter for the center auxiliary tank  |
| Aft Filter    | Aft               | Filter for the aft auxiliary tank     |

## Fuel System Operation

The fuel system is designed to operate automatically, with manual override capabilities for specific situations. The following sections outline the normal operation and emergency procedures for the fuel system.

### Normal Operation

During normal operation, the fuel system automatically manages fuel flow between tanks and to the engines. The main pumps in the wing tanks supply fuel to the engines, while the auxiliary pumps transfer fuel from the center and aft tanks to the wing tanks as needed. The crossfeed valve allows for fuel transfer between wing tanks to maintain balance and ensure continuous fuel supply.

### Emergency Procedures

In the event of a fuel system malfunction, the following emergency procedures should be followed:

1. Identify the affected component and isolate it using the appropriate shutoff valve.
2. Activate the boost pump to ensure continuous fuel supply to the engine.
3. Monitor fuel pressure and flow indicators to ensure proper fuel delivery.
4. If necessary, transfer fuel between tanks using the crossfeed valve to maintain balance and prevent fuel starvation.

## Documentation and Records

All maintenance activities related to the fuel system must be documented in the aircraft's maintenance logbook. The following information should be recorded for each maintenance task:

- Date and time of maintenance
- Description of task performed
- Name and signature of technician
- Part numbers and serial numbers of replaced components
- Any discrepancies or issues found and corrective actions taken
