## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

Heuritmática is a self-adaptive decision-making framework designed for dynamic, multi-layered AI-driven control systems. It serves as the core cognitive layer for robotic intelligence, predictive modeling, and optimization within GAIA AIR, interfacing directly with IP4MLP (Intelligent Predictive & Prescriptive Maintenance & Logistics Platform) and Robotics Braining (RB).

This document provides the mathematical foundations of Heuritmática, establishing its role as an evolutionary, reinforcement-based decision function that continuously refines control heuristics through iterative feedback loops.

### 1.2 Scope

Heuritmática serves as a meta-decision engine, integrating:

*   **Bayesian Inference:** For probabilistic decision-making.
*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** For adaptive optimization.
*   **Topological Heuristics:** For multi-modal AI guidance.
*   **Quantum-Inspired Search (QIS):** For high-dimensional problem-solving.
*   **Pelliccia’s Equations:** For structured data-driven learning.

This document covers:

✅ The mathematical formulation of Heuritmática.

✅ The learning architecture and algorithmic implementation.

✅ The integration with Robotics Braining (RB) and IP4MLP.

✅ The scalability and modularity within GAIA AIR.

## 2. Heuritmática as a Meta-Decision System

Heuritmática is formalized as a hierarchical decision function ( H(Θ, X, T) ), where:

```
H(Θ, X, T) = E[f(X, T) | Θ]
```

where:

*   **( \Theta ) (Theta):** Represents the heuristic parameter space, dynamically updated via learning.
*   **( X ):** Represents the state space, encompassing robotic actions, environmental conditions, and sensor inputs.
*   **( T ):** Represents the temporal sequence, ensuring time-dependent learning and adaptation.

At its core, Heuritmática maps uncertainty to optimal action selection, iterating through reinforcement learning and Bayesian filtering to refine decisions.

## 3. Mathematical Formalization

### 3.1 Bayesian Learning in Heuritmática

In recognition of the partially observable nature of real-world environments, Heuritmática employs a Bayesian update rule for refining heuristic parameters ( \Theta ) over time:

```
P(\Theta_t | X_t, T_t) = \frac{P(X_t | \Theta_t, T_t) P(\Theta_t | T_t)}{P(X_t | T_t)}
```

where:

*   ( P(\Theta_t \mid X_t, T_t) ) is the posterior probability of the heuristic set given observed states.
*   ( P(X_t \mid \Theta_t, T_t) ) is the likelihood of observed transitions given heuristics.
*   ( P(\Theta_t \mid T_t) ) is the prior distribution of heuristics based on time-adaptive policies.
*   ( P(X_t \mid T_t) ) is the evidence distribution, ensuring normalization.

Each decision iteration updates ( \Theta ), leading to adaptive learning.

### 3.2 Reinforcement Learning (Heuristics Update Function)

Heuritmática optimizes its decision function via reinforcement learning, using a Temporal-Difference (TD) learning approach:

```
\Theta_{t+1} = \Theta_t + \alpha [R_t + \gamma H(\Theta, X, T) - H(\Theta_t, X_t, T_t)]
```

where:

*   ( \Theta_t ) are the heuristic parameters at step ( t ).
*   ( \alpha ) is the learning rate.
*   ( R_t ) is the reward (a function of system performance).
*   ( \gamma ) is the discount factor, controlling the balance between short-term vs. long-term adaptation.
*   ( H(\Theta, X, T) ) is the estimated optimal heuristic.

The policy ( \pi ) in Heuritmática selects the best action adaptively, using an ( \epsilon )-greedy strategy:

```
\pi(X_t) = \arg\max_a H(\Theta_t, X_t, T_t) \quad \text{with probability } (1-\epsilon)
```

With probability ( \epsilon ), an exploratory action is taken. Over time, ( \epsilon ) decays, shifting from exploration to exploitation.

## 4. Quantum-Inspired Search (QIS) in Heuritmática

Heuritmática leverages Quantum-Inspired Search (QIS) to navigate high-dimensional action spaces.

We approximate heuristic search using Quantum Amplitude Amplification:

```
H(\Theta, X, T) \approx \sum_{a \in A} A(X, a) \cdot e^{i \Theta_a}
```

where:

*   ( A(X, a) ) is the probability amplitude of selecting action ( a ).
*   ( \Theta_a ) is the phase encoding the heuristic energy landscape.

For long-term decision paths, we compute an entangled multi-step heuristic evaluation:

```
H(X, T) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} [U(X_t, \Theta_t)]
```

where ( U(X_t, \Theta_t) ) is a unitary evolution operator, encoding multi-path action selection.

## 5. Integration with Robotics Braining (RB) and IP4MLP

### 5.1 Interaction with Robotics Braining

Heuritmática serves as the cognitive control layer for RB, executing adaptive, multi-level robotic actions.

```
RB = H(\Theta, X, T) \rightarrow \pi(X_t)
```

**Key Contributions to Robotics Braining:**

*   **Dynamic Decision Execution:** RB receives continuous heuristic updates, refining robotic motions in real-time.
*   **Multi-Sensor Adaptation:** Heuritmática aligns RB’s sensor fusion strategies with heuristic-driven optimization.

### 5.2 Integration with IP4MLP

Heuritmática drives predictive analytics and optimization for IP4MLP:

```
IP4MLP = H(\Theta, X, T) \rightarrow \text{Predictive Analytics & Optimization}
```

**Key Contributions to IP4MLP:**

*   **Predictive Analytics:** Enhanced forecasting of failures and maintenance needs.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Efficient resource allocation across maintenance and logistics.
