# **HeuritmÃ¡tica Foundations Document**

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose**
HeuritmÃ¡tica is a meta-decision framework designed for **self-adaptive decision-making** in complex and uncertain environments. It integrates **Bayesian inference, reinforcement learning (RL), and quantum-inspired search (QIS)** to optimize decision pathways dynamically. The framework is a key component in **GAIA AIR**, interfacing with **Robotics Braining (RB)** for adaptive robotics and **IP4MLP** for multi-layered predictive modeling.

#### **Use Cases**
1. **Robotic Navigation:** HeuritmÃ¡tica optimizes pathfinding for autonomous UAVs by refining motion heuristics over time.
2. **Resource Allocation:** Applied in dynamic mission planning, the framework learns optimal distributions of computational resources.
3. **Predictive Maintenance:** Through heuristic-driven anomaly detection, it preemptively identifies system failures in aerospace applications.

### **1.2 Self-Adaptive Decision-Making**
HeuritmÃ¡tica adapts by continuously refining **heuristic parameters** `Î˜`, adjusting to changes in **environmental dynamics**, **task objectives**, and **system configurations**. Adaptation is achieved through:
- **Bayesian updates**, which infer improved decision weights.
- **Temporal-Difference Learning (TD-Learning)** for iterative improvement.
- **Quantum-inspired search**, enhancing multi-path decision exploration.

## **2. HeuritmÃ¡tica as a Meta-Decision System**

### **2.1 Decision Function Representation**

The system models decision-making as an optimal function:
\[ f(X,T) \]
where:
- `X` is the current state.
- `T` is the time horizon.

HeuritmÃ¡tica refines an **approximate heuristic function**:
\[ H(\Theta, X, T) \approx E[f(X,T) \mid \Theta] \]
where `H(Î˜,X,T)` estimates the expected optimality of an action in state `X` at time `T`.

**Clarification of `f(X,T)`:** `f(X,T)` represents the idealized outcome metric the system aims to approximate. This could be:
- **A reward function in RL** (e.g., completion time, energy efficiency).
- **A probabilistic success measure** (e.g., UAV mission success probability).
- **A performance predictor** (e.g., expected system uptime in predictive maintenance).

### **2.2 Uncertainty Mapping in Decision Selection**
HeuritmÃ¡tica maps uncertainty into decision refinement by:
- Using **Bayesian priors** to quantify initial uncertainty.
- Adjusting weights via **Bayesian posterior updates**.
- Employing **RL exploration strategies** to refine decision pathways.

## **3. Mathematical Formalization**

### **3.1 Bayesian Learning for Heuristic Optimization**
HeuritmÃ¡tica updates heuristic parameters `Î˜` by computing:
\[ P(\Theta_t \mid T_t) = \frac{P(T_t \mid \Theta_t) P(\Theta_t)}{P(T_t)} \]
where:
- `P(Î˜t | Tt)` is the posterior belief of heuristic parameters given observations.
- `P(Tt | Î˜t)` is the likelihood of outcomes under `Î˜t`.
- `P(Î˜t)` is the prior belief.

**Operationalization:**
- If `Î˜` represents a **linear weight set**, priors can be Gaussian.
- If `Î˜` is a **neural heuristic function**, priors could be initialized as uniform distributions.
- **Non-parametric approaches** (e.g., Bayesian Neural Networks) may be employed for richer adaptation.

### **3.2 Temporal-Difference Learning for Decision Improvement**
HeuritmÃ¡tica refines `H(Î˜, X, T)` using TD-learning:
\[ H(\Theta_{t+1}, X_t, T_t) = H(\Theta_t, X_t, T_t) + \alpha \left( R_t + \gamma H(\Theta_t, X_{t+1}, T_{t+1}) - H(\Theta_t, X_t, T_t) \right) \]
where:
- `Î±` is the learning rate.
- `Î³` is the discount factor.
- `R_t` is the reward function (e.g., energy efficiency, safety margin).

#### **Exploration Strategy (Îµ-Greedy with Exponential Decay)**
The action policy follows:
\[ \pi(X_t) = \arg\max_a H(\Theta_t, X_t, T_t) \]
with `Îµ`-greedy exploration:
\[ P(a = a_{random}) = \epsilon_t, \quad P(a = a_{best}) = 1 - \epsilon_t \]
where `Îµ_t` decays exponentially:
\[ \epsilon_t = \epsilon_0 e^{-\lambda t} \]

## **4. Quantum-Inspired Search (QIS)**

**Important Note:** This is a **quantum-inspired classical method**, leveraging probability amplitudes for enhanced search efficiency.

### **4.1 Heuristic Weighting via Amplitude Encoding**
Each action `a` in state `X` is assigned:
\[ A(X, a) e^{i \Theta_a} \]
where:
- `A(X, a)` is a **classical heuristic weight**, initialized from heuristic evaluations.
- `Î˜_a` is an **adjustment parameter**, modulating search priority.

### **4.2 Multi-Step Heuristic Evolution**
A multi-step heuristic sequence follows:
\[ H(\Theta, X, T) = \prod_{t=1}^{T} U(X_t, \Theta_t) H(\Theta_t, X_t, T_t) \]
where `U(X_t, Î˜_t)` is a transformation updating heuristic estimates based on prior actions.

### **4.3 Computational Advantage of QIS**
QIS improves **multi-path exploration** by allowing:
- **Interference-like effects** between heuristic evaluations.
- **Adaptive heuristic shifts** in response to discovered optima.

## **5. Integration with GAIA AIR Systems**

### **5.1 Robotics Braining (RB) Interface**
- **Heuristics `Î˜` are fed into RB's control policies**, guiding robotic motion and autonomy.
- **RB feedback loops update heuristic priors**, refining future predictions.

### **5.2 IP4MLP Meta-Learning Interface**
- **IP4MLP leverages refined heuristics for adaptive learning.**
- **Meta-learning adjusts HeuritmÃ¡ticaâ€™s priors**, improving long-term learning efficiency.

#### **Example Feedback Loops:**
- **RB Example:** If UAV trajectory deviates, HeuritmÃ¡tica updates `Î˜` to prioritize corrective actions.
- **IP4MLP Example:** If HeuritmÃ¡tica improves response efficiency, IP4MLP adapts its search priors accordingly.

## **6. Scalability and Modularity**
### **6.1 Scalability**
- Supports **distributed parallel learning** for complex environments.
- Scales across increasing state/action spaces via **hierarchical heuristics**.

### **6.2 Modularity**
- **Independent optimization layers** for Bayesian, RL, and QIS components.
- Easily **plugged into AI ecosystems** like RB and IP4MLP.

## **7. Conclusion**
HeuritmÃ¡tica provides an **adaptive, multi-layered decision framework**, integrating **Bayesian inference, reinforcement learning, and quantum-inspired search**. Through its interfaces with **RB and IP4MLP**, it enhances robotic intelligence and predictive modeling, supporting GAIA AIRâ€™s vision of **autonomous aerospace optimization**.
